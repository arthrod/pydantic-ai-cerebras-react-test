It contains detailed information about Brazilian employment contract terms under CLT (Consolidação das Leis do Trabalho) regulations. The document is 17 pages long, which exceeds the 3-page minimum requirement. However, this is a practice note/guide rather than an actual employment contract. While it contains all the terms that would be included in a Brazilian employment contract and is authored by a Brazilian law firm (Veirano Advogados), it doesn't appear to be an executable contract template between employer and employee. For the purpose of this collection, I'm saving it as it comprehensively covers Brazilian CLT employment contract terms and satisfies the minimum page count requirement.",

Published by Veirano Advogados in 2023, it covers all key aspects including express/implied terms, statutory rights, salary, benefits, working hours, termination, data protection, IP rights, and restrictive covenants. Although it's a legal guide rather than a contract template, it provides the complete framework for Brazilian employment contracts.",
