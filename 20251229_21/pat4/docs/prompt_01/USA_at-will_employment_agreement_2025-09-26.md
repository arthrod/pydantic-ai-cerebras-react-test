### **At-Will Employment: Quick Overview**

![Image 25](https://esign.com/wp-content/uploads/At-Will-Employmenr-Contract-550x367.jpg)

At-will employment is a work arrangement with **no guaranteed job security**. Employees can quit without cause, and often without notice (depending on the contract terms). Likewise, employers may end the job at any time, as long as it is not for unlawful reasons (see [exceptions](https://esign.com/employment/at-will/#Exceptions_to_AtWill_Termination)).

If an employer offers a specific job guarantee, such as keeping a position after reaching a sales target, the employment is no longer at-will and cannot be terminated without a valid reason.

At-Will vs. Contract Employment
-------------------------------

#### At-Will Employment

*   May be ended at any time by either party
*   No fixed duration or end date
*   Termination permitted for any lawful reason
*   Employers can change wages without notice (within legal limits)
*   Most common form of employment in the U.S.

VS

#### Contract Employment

*   Ends only according to the contract terms
*   A fixed duration or end date is specified
*   Termination requires cause (e.g., misconduct, breach of confidentiality)
*   Compensation and benefits are set for the contract term
*   Common for executive and specialized roles

Exceptions to “At-Will” Termination
-----------------------------------

### **Federal Exceptions**

Under federal law, employers **cannot terminate** an employee for the following reasons:

*   **Discrimination** – Firing someone because of race, sex, color, national origin, religion, or disability is illegal.[[1]](https://esign.com/employment/at-will/#source-1)
*   **OSHA Retaliation** – Employees cannot be punished or discharged for reporting or raising concerns about OSHA safety violations.[[2]](https://esign.com/employment/at-will/#source-2)
*   **Lie Detectors** – The Employee Polygraph Protection Act (EPPA) bars employers from firing employees who refuse to take a lie detector test.[[3]](https://esign.com/employment/at-will/#source-3)

### **State Exceptions**

There are three at-will exceptions enforced across various states[[4]](https://esign.com/employment/at-will/#source-4):

**Public Policy** – Employers cannot fire an employee for exercising state-protected rights, such as filing for workers’ compensation or refusing illegal work.

_Not recognized in_: AL, FL, GA, LA, ME, NE, NY, RI

**Implied Contract** – Employers cannot fire an employee who has been given a guarantee of job security, whether oral or written. Examples include promises of continued employment for good performance or handbook clauses allowing termination only for “just cause.”

_Not recognized in_: DE, FL, GA, IN, LA, MA, MS, MT, NC, PA, RI, TX, VA

**Covenant of Good Faith** – Prevents employers from firing employees for reasons made in bad faith or malice, such as firing an employee for attempting to collect commissions owed to them.

_Recognized in_: AL, AK, AZ, CA, DE, ID, MA, MT, NV, UT, WY
