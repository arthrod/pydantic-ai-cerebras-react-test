In consideration of good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Executive covenants and agrees with the Company that during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the first anniversary of the date of the termination of Executive’s employment with the Company (the “Noncompete Period”), Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, either for himself or for or through any other Person, participate in any business or enterprise conducting business in any Covered MSA which provides or proposes to provide local, long distance, internet access, or other data, voice or internet services of the type the Company provides or proposes to provide as evidenced by a business plan which has been approved by or submitted to the Board, which in the case of a submitted business plan, has not been rejected by the Board; provided that after such termination of employment, nothing herein shall prohibit Executive (1)from engaging in any activity in which he or she did not engage on behalf of the Company prior to such termination of employment or (2)from entering into any employment in, or with an employer that conducts business in, any Covered MSA if Executive has not performed any services on behalf of the Company in such Covered MSA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Executive agrees that, during the Noncompete Period, Executive shall not compete against the Company by soliciting any customer or prospective customer of the Company in any Covered MSA with whom Executive had any business dealings or contracts on behalf of the Company during the two years prior to the such termination of employment. Executive agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, (i)the term “participate in” includes having any direct or indirect interest in any Person, whether as a sole proprietor, owner, stockholder, partner, joint venture, creditor or otherwise, or rendering any direct or indirect service or assistance to any Person (whether as a director, officer, manager, supervisor, employee, agent, consultant or otherwise), other than owning up to 5% of the outstanding stock of any class that is publicly traded, (ii)the term “MSA” means metropolitan statistical area and (iii)the term “Covered MSA” means the MSAs set forth on Schedule I attached hereto (it being understood that the Company has been formed for the purpose of carrying on business in all of the Covered MSAs).

(e) Nonsolicitation. During the Noncompete Period, Executive shall not (i)induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Company to leave the employ of the Company, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company and any employee thereof, or (ii)call on, solicit or service any customer, supplier, licensee, licensor or other business relation

5

* * *

(f) Non-Disparagement. During the Noncompete Period and in perpetuity thereafter, Executive shall not directly or indirectly make any statement that will or may have the effect of disparaging the Company, or which is or may be derogatory of the Company

(g) Judicial Modification. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section 3 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or geographic area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment or decision may be appealed.

(l) Code Section 409A.

If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, one shall be appointed by the AAA in accordance with its Rules. Each party shall pay the fees of its own attorneys, the expenses of its witnesses and all other expenses connected with presenting its case; _however_, Executive and the Company agree that, to the extent permitted by law, the arbitrator may, in his discretion, award reasonable attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party. Other costs of the arbitration, including the cost of any record or transcripts of the arbitration, AAA’s administrative fees, the fee of the arbitrator, and all other fees and costs, shall be borne by the Company. This Section 4(m) is intended to be the exclusive method for resolving any and all claims by the parties against each other for payment of damages under this Agreement or relating to Executive’s employment; provided, however, that neither this Agreement nor the submission to arbitration shall limit the parties’ right to seek provisional relief, including, without limitation, injunctive relief, in any court of competent jurisdiction to the extent permitted by applicable law. Seeking any such relief shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such party’s right to compel arbitration. Both Executive and the Company expressly waive their right to a jury trial. Each party warrants that it was represented by counsel in the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, including the attorneys’ fees provision herein.
