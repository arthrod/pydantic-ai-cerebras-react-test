there are 4 different ways i can achieve my goal, as you can see at 4_configs.md. please prepare each config in a separate file. each must have a similar prompt, but slightly adapted for the different constructions. we will then,m have a 20_iterations.py with a list of 20 prompts that we should pass to each config. we will measure the speed and result of each configuration to detrermine which is the most appropriate to our case. 

model is zai-glm-4.6
