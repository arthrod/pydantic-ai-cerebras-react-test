Finish Reason: The Jina AI search function is returning 401 Unauthorized errors on all search attempts, preventing me from finding any court briefs. This appears to be a technical issue with the search tool that is blocking all queries. Since I cannot search for or locate any Brazilian petições iniciais from TJSP e-SAJ or American motions to dismiss from PACER, I cannot collect the requested documents. The search function needs to be working to find court briefs with docket numbers that meet the ≥8 pages requirement.
