Finish Reason: Unable to locate the specific lease agreements requested. The search system returned 401 Unauthorized errors preventing access to Jina AI Search, and direct URL fetching attempts resulted in either 404 errors or content that did not contain actual lease agreements. Despite trying multiple government websites (SEC, Federal Register, Delaware Courts) and legal platforms, I was unable to find: 1) Brazilian commercial leases (locação não-residencial) from São Paulo registry, or 2) American commercial leases from SEC 10-K/10-Q exhibits that meet the ≥10 page requirement. The 5 items saved are mostly error pages or irrelevant government content rather than the specific lease documents requested.
