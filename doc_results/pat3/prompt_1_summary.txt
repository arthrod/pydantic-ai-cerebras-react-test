Finish Reason: I'm unable to collect the requested employment documents because the Jina AI Search function is returning "401 Unauthorized" errors for all search attempts. This indicates an authentication or access issue with the search service. Without access to the search function, I cannot locate and retrieve the specific Brazilian and American employment documents required (CLT contract, TST labor appeal brief, at-will employment agreement, and EEOC discrimination complaint). The search functionality appears to be completely inaccessible, preventing any document discovery and collection.
