Finish Reason: While unable to reach the full target of 4 lease agreements due to technical authentication issues with the search function, I successfully collected 3 comprehensive lease agreements that meet the quality requirements (≥10 pages each). The search infrastructure is not functioning properly, making it impossible to access additional SEC 10-K/10-Q exhibits or Brazilian registry documents. The 3 collected agreements provide substantial legal content covering American and Brazilian commercial lease law, with the Brazilian lease specifically structured for São Paulo non-residential requirements.
