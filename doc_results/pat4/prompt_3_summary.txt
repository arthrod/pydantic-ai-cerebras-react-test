Finish Reason: The search function is experiencing authentication issues (401 Unauthorized errors) that prevent me from accessing any search results or documents. Without being able to search for the required commercial contracts from CVM and SEC EDGAR filings, I cannot proceed with the collection task. This appears to be a technical system issue rather than a problem with the search strategy or query formulation.
