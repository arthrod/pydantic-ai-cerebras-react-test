April 3, 2015

To the stockholders of Aruba Networks, Inc.:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders, which we refer to as the “Special Meeting”, of Aruba Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which we refer to as “Aruba”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”, to be held on May 1, 2015, at 9:00 a.m., Pacific time, at our principal executive offices at 1344 Crossman Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089.

At the Special Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, as it may be amended from time to time, which we refer to as the “Merger Agreement”, dated March 2, 2015, by and among Aruba, Hewlett-Packard Company, which we refer to as “HP” or “Parent”, and Aspen Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of HP, which we refer to as “Merger Sub”, and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (as defined below). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Aruba, which we refer to as the “Merger”, and Aruba will become a wholly owned subsidiary of HP. At the Special Meeting, you will also be asked to consider and vote on a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $24.67 in cash, without interest, for each share of common stock of Aruba that you own (unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights), which represents a premium of approximately (i)44% from the average closing price of Aruba’s common stock in the 30 calendar day period prior to February 24, 2015, the last trading day prior to the date when specific rumors were reported publicly that Aruba and HP were negotiating an acquisition transaction and (ii)34% from the unaffected closing price of Aruba’s common stock on February 24, 2015.

**The Board of Directors of Aruba, which we refer to as the “Board of Directors”, after considering the factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, has unanimously (1)determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby are fair to and in the best interests of Aruba’s stockholders; (2)approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (3)directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Aruba for adoption; and (4)resolved to recommend that Aruba stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Board of Directors recommends that you vote (1)“FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (2)“FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3)“FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.**

The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the Special Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the Merger. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement. The proxy statement also describes the actions and determinations of the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. We encourage you to read the proxy statement and its annexes, including the Merger Agreement, carefully and in their entirety, as they contain important information.

Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, please sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically

**_Aruba Networks, Inc._**

Aruba is a leading global provider of enterprise mobility solutions. Aruba develops, markets and sells products and services that help solve its customers’ secure mobility requirements through its Mobility-Defined Networks, a network architecture designed to automatically optimize infrastructure-wide performance and trigger security actions that previously required manual intervention by information technology, which we refer to as “IT”, departments. Aruba Mobility-Defined Networks are comprised of the following three major components: Aruba’s mobility-centric network infrastructure, Aruba’s ClearPass Access Management System, and Aruba’s mobility applications. Aruba’s goal is to provide simplified, dependable solutions that enable IT departments to quickly, securely and cost-effectively meet their mobility and bring-your-own-device needs. Aruba’s Mobility-Defined Networks are designed for the all-wireless workplace and an increasingly mobile universe of end-users, who Aruba refers to as GenMobile, who rely on mobile devices for nearly every aspect of their work life and personal communication. Aruba derives its revenue primarily from sales of Mobility Controllers with ArubaOS operating system software, controller-less and controller-managed wireless access points, value-added security software modules, access management system solutions, multi-vendor management software, mobility management solutions and other software, Mobility Access Switches, and support and professional services. Aruba has offices in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions and employs staff around the world.

Aruba’s common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, which we refer to as “NASDAQ”, under the symbol “ARUN”.

Aruba’s principal executive office is located at 1344 Crossman Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089 and its telephone number is (408)227-4500.

**_Hewlett-Packard Company_**

HP, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, is a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors.

**_Aspen Acquisition Sub, Inc._**

Aspen Acquisition Sub, Inc. is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of HP and was formed on February 25, 2015, solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and has not engaged in any business activities other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub will merge with and into Aruba, and Aruba will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of HP, which we refer to as the “Surviving Corporation”. As a result of the Merger, Aruba will cease to be a publicly traded company and all outstanding shares of Aruba stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $24.67 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, which we refer to as the “Merger Consideration”, except for (i)any shares held in the treasury of Aruba or owned, directly or indirectly, by HP or Merger Sub, and (ii)any shares owned by stockholders who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law, which we refer to as the “DGCL”, and you will no longer own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder (except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law, as described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger — Appraisal Rights_”).

If the Merger is completed and your shares of our common stock are held in book-entry form, the paying agent (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement — Exchange and Payment Procedures_”) will issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares without any further action on your part. If you are a stockholder of record with your shares held in certificate form, you will receive a letter of transmittal with instructions on how to send your shares of our common stock to the paying agent in connection with the Merger. The paying agent will issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares after you comply with these instructions. **Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.** See the section in this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement — Exchange and Payment Procedures_”.

If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your shares held in “street name”.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger— Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger_”) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares of our common stock in the Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the Merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in this proxy statement in the section captioned “_The Merger— Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger_”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the Merger, unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger— Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger_.” **Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. Federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.**

**[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm)Treatment of Equity Incentives (Page 78)**

As a result of the Merger, the treatment of Aruba’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the time at which the Merger will become effective, which we refer to as the “Effective Time”, will be as follows:

**_Options_**

At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of our common stock, granted under the Company’s 2002 Stock Plan, 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, and the AirWave Wireless, Inc. 2000 Stock Plan, which we refer to collectively as the “Company Stock Plans”, that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a person providing services to us immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become an option with respect to HP common stock and HP will assume each unvested option to purchase shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and the terms of the applicable stock option agreement, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i)HP and its compensation committee will be substituted for the Company and the compensation committee of Aruba’s Board of Directors administering such Company Stock Plans; (ii)each unvested option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for HP common stock (or cash, if permitted under the terms of the applicable unvested option or required under applicable law); (iii)the number of shares of HP common stock subject to the unvested option will be equal to the number of shares of our common stock subject to the option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio (as described below), rounded down to the nearest whole share; and (iv)the per share exercise price for each such option will be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each such unvested option by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent. However, any unvested, unexercised and outstanding options to purchase our common stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have a per share exercise price greater than $24.67 will not be assumed by HP and will automatically terminate as of the Effective Time. As used herein, “Exchange Ratio” means the quotient obtained by _dividing_(x)$24.67 _by_(y)the average closing sale price of one share of HP common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date on which the Merger is consummated, which we refer to as the “Parent Closing Price”.

At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of our common stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and each former holder of any such cancelled vested option will be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to any applicable withholdings or other taxes, or other amounts as required by law) equal to the product of (1)the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock subject to such vested option as of the Effective Time and (2)the amount, if any, by which $24.67 exceeds the exercise price per share of common stock underlying such stock option. Each option with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than $24.67 per share will be cancelled without any cash payment.

**_Restricted Stock Units_**

At the Effective Time, each award of unvested restricted stock units (including each market stock unit), which we refer to as the “Restricted Stock Units”, granted under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a person providing services to us immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those Restricted Stock Units that will become vested as a result of the consummation of the Merger) will be converted into and become rights with respect to shares of HP common stock and HP will assume the Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plans and/or restricted stock unit agreement, as applicable, except that from and after the Effective Time (i)HP and its compensation committee will be substituted for the Company and the compensation committee of Aruba’s Board of Directors administering such Company Stock Plans; (ii)the Restricted Stock Units assumed by HP will represent the right to receive shares of HP common stock (or cash, if permitted under the terms of the applicable Restricted Stock Units or as required by law) upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units promptly after vesting (except to the extent the terms of the applicable Restricted Stock Unit provide for deferred settlement, in which case settlement will be in accordance with the specified terms); and (iii)the number of shares of HP common stock subject to the Restricted Stock Units will equal the number of shares of our common stock subject to the applicable Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and HP will convert any remaining fractional share into the right to receive cash based on the Parent Closing Price.

Pursuant to the individual market stock unit agreements, at the Effective Time, the (i)number of earned market stock units will be determined by shortening the performance period to end upon the Effective Time, which we refer to as the “Earned MSUs”, and (ii)a participant will vest in the number of Earned MSUs equal to (A)(1) the number of fully completed calendar months that have elapsed from the commencement of the performance period set forth in the market stock unit agreements through the Effective Time, _divided by_ (2)the total number of months in the original performance period (notwithstanding the Merger), _multiplied by_ (B)the Earned MSUs, with the result rounded down to the nearest whole share. The Earned MSUs that vest at the Effective Time will receive the Merger Consideration. The Earned MSUs that do not vest under the individual market stock unit agreements at the Effective Time will be converted into Restricted Stock Units of HP at the Effective Time (with the adjustments described in the paragraph above) and will vest in equal quarterly installments at the end of each three month period following the Effective Time, with the number of quarterly vesting dates equal to (i)(A) the total number of months in the original performance period set forth in the market stock unit agreement (notwithstanding the Merger) _less_ (B)the number of fully completed calendar months that have elapsed from the commencement of the performance period through the Effective Time, _divided by_ (ii)three (rounded down to the nearest whole number). However, 100% of the Earned MSUs that are unvested as of the last day of the original performance period will vest on the last day of the original performance period, unless vested earlier. The market stock units that do not become Earned MSUs will be forfeited at the Effective Time.

**[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm)Conditions to the Merger (Page 94)**

Each party’s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions at or prior to the Effective Time:

•the Merger Agreement shall have been adopted by the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common stock, which we refer to as the “Company Stockholder Approval”;

•the required antitrust approvals pursuant to the HSR Act and the antitrust laws of certain other countries will have been obtained, waived, or made, as applicable, and the respective waiting periods required in connection with such required antitrust approvals will have expired or terminated; and

•no order, injunction, ruling or other legal restraint and no provision of law will prohibit or make illegal the consummation of the Merger.

After considering various factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger — Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger_,” Aruba’s Board of Directors, which we refer to as the “Board of Directors”, unanimously (1)determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby are fair to and in the best interests of Aruba’s stockholders; (2)approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (3)directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Aruba for adoption and (4)resolved to recommend that Aruba stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1)“**FOR**” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (2)“**FOR**” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3)“**FOR**” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

We retained Qatalyst Partners to act as one of our financial advisors in connection with the Merger. We selected Qatalyst Partners to act as one of our financial advisors based on Qatalyst Partners’ qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of our business and affairs and the industry in which we operate. At the meeting of the Board of Directors on March 1, 2015, Qatalyst Partners rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of March 1, 2015 and based upon and subject to the considerations, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the consideration to be received by Aruba’s stockholders, other than HP or any affiliates of HP, pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to those Aruba stockholders.

The full text of the written opinion of Qatalyst Partners, dated March 1, 2015, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference.

the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. You should read the opinion carefully in its entirety. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion was provided to the Board of Directors and addressed only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be received by Aruba’s stockholders, other than HP or any affiliates of HP, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. It does not address any other aspect of the Merger and does not constitute a recommendation as to how any of our stockholders should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter.

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. In (i)evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii)approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii)recommending that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby be adopted by Aruba’s stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. These interests include the following:

•the entitlement of each executive officer who is eligible to participate in the Company’s Severance and Change of Control Policy for Officers and Directors, effective September 19, 2014, which we refer to as the “Severance and Change of Control Policy”, to receive payments and benefits under the Severance and Change of Control Policy in connection with an involuntary termination of service other than for “Cause” or voluntary resignation following certain circumstances as set forth in the Severance and Change of Control Policy within the 12 month period following the Effective Time, which may include:

•accelerated vesting of shares subject to each equity-based award held by eligible executive officers;

•a lump sum severance payment equal to a percentage of the executive officers’ annual base salary and annual target bonus; and

•Company-provided health continuation coverage for a period of time following termination.

•the fact that certain officers entered or may enter into new employment agreements with HP, which employment agreements may provide new equity awards to purchase HP common stock, acceleration of a portion of outstanding Aruba equity awards as of the Effective Time, and severance benefits, subject to the execution of a general release in favor of HP, in the event of a termination by HP, that supersede those provided in the Severance and Change of Control Policy, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger—Interests of Aruba’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—HP Employment Agreements_”;

•at the Effective Time, a number of Restricted Stock Units that are market stock units held by executive officers may become earned by evaluating performance based on a shortened performance period that will end upon the Effective Time and a certain number of such earned market stock units, if any, will vest at the Effective Time based on the number of those fully completed calendar months that have elapsed from the beginning of the performance period; and that the remaining earned market stock units, if any, will vest in equal quarterly installments at the end of each three month period following the Effective Time over the number of months remaining in the original performance period;

•the entitlement of non-employee directors to receive accelerated vesting on any of their options or restricted stock units in the event their service is involuntarily terminated or they resign at the request of HP in connection with the consummation of the Merger; and

•continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.

If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is approved, the shares of common stock held by our directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of common stock held by all other stockholders. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger—Interests of Aruba’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger_.”

**[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm)Appraisal Rights (Page 65)**

If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, who continuously hold their shares of common stock through the Effective Time, and who properly demand appraisal of their shares of common stock in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, which we refer to as “Section 262”, will be entitled to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262. This means that holders of shares of common stock who may exercise appraisal rights and who also have properly exercised and not lost those appraisal rights are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, so long as those holders comply exactly with the procedures established by Section 262.

**Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of common stock are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the Merger Consideration.**

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL, including, (i)delivering a written demand for appraisal to Aruba before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (ii)not submitting a proxy or otherwise voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; and (iii)continuing to hold your shares of common stock of record through the Effective Time. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such bank, brokerage firm or nominee. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and Section 262 regarding appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Aruba may not, and may not permit or authorize any of its subsidiaries or any director, officer, employee, investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative of Aruba or its subsidiaries, which we refer to collectively for the purposes of this section as “representatives,” to take certain actions to solicit or otherwise facilitate alternative acquisition proposals and transactions, including:

•soliciting, initiating, endorsing, knowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to, or the making or completion of, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), or any inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal;

•entering into, continuing or otherwise participating in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnishing to any person any information or data with respect to any Acquisition Proposal;

•making an adverse recommendation change, except as described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement_ —_Other Covenants Under the Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; Change in the Recommendation of Aruba’s Board of Directors_”; or

•resolving, agreeing or proposing to do any of the foregoing.

Any violation of the restrictions, procedures and agreements set forth in the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement by any representative of Aruba or any of its subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of Aruba or any of its subsidiaries, or otherwise, will be deemed to be a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement by Aruba.

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, this covenant will not prohibit Aruba, at any time prior to obtaining the approval of the Merger Agreement of its stockholders, from (x)furnishing information (including non-public information) regarding Aruba and its subsidiaries to a person making an Acquisition Proposal (subject to the execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement) containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to Aruba than, those set forth in the confidentiality agreement entered into by HP and Aruba in connection with the transaction (including the “standstill” provisions contained therein), which we refer to as the “Confidentiality Agreement”, and (y)participating in discussions and negotiations with the person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal if:

•Aruba has received a written Acquisition Proposal that its Board of Directors believes in good faith to be bona fide;

•such Acquisition Proposal was unsolicited and did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement;

•its Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below); and

•its Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take the actions described in clauses (x)and (y)above would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Aruba under applicable law.

In the event that Aruba enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, Aruba is required, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, to provide to HP (i)a non-redacted copy of each confidentiality agreement into which Aruba has entered into in accordance with the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement and (ii)any non-public information provided to any person who has made that applicable Acquisition Proposal. No commercially or competitively sensitive non-public information may be provided to such person except in accordance with “clean room” or similar procedures consistent in all material respects with Aruba’s practices in dealing with the disclosure of such information to HP and its representatives in connection with the negotiation of the Merger Agreement.

In addition to any obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement with regard to the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, Aruba has agreed to promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of receipt, advise HP in writing (including via e-mail) in the event that Aruba or any of its subsidiaries or representatives receives (i)any indication that any person is considering an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)any inquiry or request for information, discussion or negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead to or contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii)any proposal or offer that is or is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case together with a description of the material terms and conditions of and facts surrounding any such

indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, the identity of the person making any such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, and a copy of any written proposal, offer or draft agreement provided by such person. In each case, Aruba has further agreed to (i)keep HP reasonably informed in writing (including via e-mail) in all material respects on a timely basis of the status and details (including, within 24 hours of any amendment of or modification to any Acquisition Proposal), including furnishing any relevant copies and written summaries of any material oral inquiries or discussions and (ii)promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify HP if it decides to begin providing information or engaging in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal and will not begin providing such information or engaging in these types of discussions prior to providing this notice to HP. Under the Merger Agreement, HP is entitled to at least 24 hours prior notice (or shorter, if such shorter notice is provided to the Board of Directors) of any meeting of the Board of Directors at which the Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal.

In addition to the obligations set forth above, Aruba has also agreed that it will not:

•enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the date of the Merger Agreement that would restrict Aruba’s ability to comply with any of the terms of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, and will cause its subsidiaries not to take the foregoing action; and

•take any action to exempt any person (other than HP, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) from the restrictions on “business combinations” contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar provision of any other takeover law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case unless such actions are taken substantially concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement by Aruba in order to accept a Superior Proposal in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.

As described in this proxy statement, “Acquisition Proposal” means any proposal or offer with respect to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase or license, in one transaction or a series of transactions, and whether through any merger, reorganization, consolidation, tender offer, self-tender, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, licensing or similar transaction, or otherwise, of (i)assets or businesses of Aruba and its subsidiaries that generate 15% or more of the net revenues or net income (for the twelve-month period ending on the last day of Aruba’s most recently completed fiscal quarter) or that represent 15% or more of the total assets (based on fair market value) of Aruba and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, (ii)15% or more of any class of capital stock, other equity securities or voting power of Aruba or any resulting parent company of Aruba, or (iii)15% or more of any class of capital stock, other equity securities or voting power of any one or more of Aruba’s subsidiaries which collectively generate 15% or more of the net revenues or net income (for the 12 month period ending on the last day of Aruba’s most recently completed fiscal quarter) or collectively hold 15% or more of the total assets (based on fair market value) of Aruba and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, in each case other than the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

As described in this proxy statement, “Superior Proposal” means any unsolicited bona fide binding written Acquisition Proposal that is fully financed or has fully committed financing, that Aruba’s Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal (including the likelihood that the transaction contemplated thereby will be completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis) and the person making the proposal, is more favorable to the stockholders of Aruba from a financial point of view than the Merger (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by HP in response to such proposal); provided, that, for purposes of this definition of “Superior Proposal,” references in the term “Acquisition Proposal” to “15%” shall be deemed to be references to “50%.”

As described in this proxy statement, “Intervening Event” means a material event or circumstance that was not known or reasonably foreseeable to Aruba’s Board of Directors prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, which event or circumstance, or any material consequence thereof, becomes known to Aruba’s Board of Directors prior to the receipt of approval for the Merger Agreement by Aruba’s stockholders, and does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal.

Aruba and HP may terminate the Merger Agreement at any time by mutual consent.

In addition, either Aruba or HP may terminate the Merger Agreement if:

•the Merger has not been consummated on or before February 28, 2016, which we refer to as the “outside date”; provided that the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to this provision is not available to any party whose failure to fulfill in any material respect any of its obligations under the Merger Agreement has been the primary cause of, or the primary factor that resulted in, the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before the outside date;

**_Date, Time and Place_**

A special meeting of stockholders of Aruba, which we refer to as the “Special Meeting”, will be held on May 1, 2015, at 9:00 a.m., Pacific time, at our principal executive offices at 1344 Crossman Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089.

**_Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote_**

You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of common stock at the close of business on April 2, 2015, which we refer to as the “Record Date”. You will have one vote at the Special Meeting for each share of common stock that you owned at the close of business on the Record Date.

**_Purpose_**

At the Special Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to (1)adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (2)adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3)approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

the issued and outstanding common stock of Aruba, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting.

**_Required Vote_**

If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of Aruba is required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. A failure to vote your shares of common stock and an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

Approval of each of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, and the non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s executive officers in connection with the Merger, if a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against these proposals but failure to vote your shares will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals.

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Dominic P. Orr and Keerti Melkote entered into a voting agreement with HP, which we refer to as the “Voting Agreement”. The Voting Agreement requires Mr.Orr and Mr.Melkote to vote all of their shares (i)in favor of the Merger, the adoption of the Merger Agreement and any other matters necessary for consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement; (ii)against any Acquisition Proposal (as defined by the Merger Agreement); (iii)against any proposal for any recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, amalgamation, merger, sale of assets or other business combination between the Company and any other person (other than the Merger); and (iv)against any other action that could reasonably be expected to impeded, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Voting Agreement, which we refer to collectively as the “Covered Proposals”. Mr.Orr and Mr.Melkote have waived appraisal rights and provided an irrevocable proxy. The Voting Agreement does not limit or restrict a stockholder who signs such Voting Agreement in his or her capacity as a director or officer from acting in such capacity in such person’s discretion on any matter. The Voting Agreement terminates upon the earliest of (a)the Effective Time of the Merger, (b)the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and (c)written notice of termination of the Voting Agreement by HP to Mr.Orr and Mr.Melkote. As of April 2, 2015, Mr.Orr and Mr.Melkote collectively beneficially owned approximately 4.71% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on an as-converted basis. The foregoing summary of the Voting Agreement is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the Voting Agreement. A copy of the Voting Agreement is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference.

**_Share Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers_**

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 3,019,752 shares of common stock, representing approximately 2.75% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the Record Date. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote, and Mr.Orr and Mr.Melkote have entered into the Voting Agreement obligating them to vote, all of their shares of common stock (1)“**FOR**” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; and (2)“**FOR**” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting; and have further informed us that they currently intend to vote (3)“**FOR**” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

**_Voting and Proxies_**

Any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the Special Meeting may submit a proxy by returning a signed proxy card by mail in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or granting a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, or may vote in person by appearing at the Special Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of common stock in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of common stock using the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters. The proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting are non-routine matters, and banks, brokers and other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. **Therefore, it is important that you cast your vote or instruct your bank, broker or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.**

If you are a stockholder of record on the Record Date, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by (1)signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting; (2)submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy; (3)delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or (4)attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in the manner specified by the holders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted “FOR” the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting, and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Shares of our common stock represented at the Special Meeting but not voted, including shares of our common stock for which proxies have been received but for which shareholders have abstained, will be treated as present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business.

Only shares affirmatively voted for the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including properly executed proxies that do not contain specific voting instructions, will be counted “FOR” that proposal. If you abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, “AGAINST” the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, and “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you do not execute a proxy card, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, but will have no effect on the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, or on the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s executive officers in connection with the Merger. Brokers who hold shares in street name for customers have the authority to vote on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, brokers are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to approval of non-routine matters, such as the proposal regarding adoption of the

Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, brokers are not empowered to vote those shares, referred to generally as “broker non-votes.” Broker non-votes will be treated as shares that are present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists and will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, but will have no effect on the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, or on the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s executive officers in connection with the Merger.

If the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Aruba stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Aruba will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the “SEC”. Under specified circumstances, Aruba will be required to pay HP a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement. For more details see the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger— Effect on Aruba if the Merger is Not Completed_”.

**_Delaware Actions_**

Beginning on March 9, 2015, a number of shareholder class action complaints were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware on behalf of a putative class of Aruba shareholders and naming as defendants the board of directors of Aruba, HP, Merger Sub, and, in some instances, Aruba: _Ballester v. Aruba Networks, Inc., et al._, C.A. No.10765-VCL (filed March 9, 2015); _Williams v. Aruba Networks, Inc., et al._, C.A. No.10778-VCL (filed March 11, 2015); _New Jersey Building Laborers Statewide Welfare Fund v. Orr, et al._, C.A. No.10786-VCL (filed March 12, 2015); _Maturi v. Aruba Networks, Inc., et al._, C.A.

The complaints generally allege that, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Aruba by HP, Aruba’s directors breached their fiduciary duties to Aruba shareholders by, among other things, purportedly failing to take steps to maximize the value of Aruba to its shareholders, engaging in an allegedly flawed process purportedly resulting from alleged conflicts of interest, and agreeing to allegedly preclusive deal protection devices in the Merger Agreement.The complaints further allege that HP, Merger Sub, and/or Aruba aided and abetted the individual defendants in the alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties.The complaints seek, among other things, an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed transaction, in the event that the proposed transaction is consummated, an order rescinding it and setting it aside or awarding rescissory damages, an order directing defendants to account to the class for damages allegedly sustained, and attorneys’ fees and costs.

On April 1, 2015, plaintiff New Jersey Building Laborers Statewide Welfare Fund filed an amended stockholder class action complaint naming as defendants the board of directors of Aruba, Merger Sub, and HP. The amended complaint generally alleges that, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Aruba by HP, Aruba’s directors breached their fiduciary duties to Aruba shareholders by, among other things, purportedly failing to take steps to maximize the value of Aruba to its shareholders, engaging in an allegedly unfair process purportedly resulting from alleged conflicts of interest, and agreeing to allegedly preclusive deal protection devices in the Merger Agreement. The amended complaint further alleges that the defendants issued materially incomplete and misleading disclosures in the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 17, 2015,

which purportedly failed to include material information concerning, among other things, the background of the proposed transaction, data, inputs, and assumptions underlying Qatalyst’s financial valuation analyses and fairness opinion, and information concerning financial projections for Aruba.The amended complaint alleges that HP and Merger Sub aided and abetted the individual defendants in the alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties.The amended complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed transaction, in the event that the proposed transaction is consummated, an order awarding damages to the class, and attorneys’ fees and costs.

**_California Action_**

On April 1, 2015, a stockholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of a putative class of Aruba stockholders and naming as defendants Aruba, the board of directors of Aruba, Merger Sub, and HP: _Newfield v. Aruba Networks, Inc., et al._, Case No.15-cv-01502-JST (N.D. Cal. filed April 1, 2015). The complaint generally alleges that, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Aruba by HP, Aruba’s directors breached their fiduciary duties to Aruba stockholders by, among other things, engaging in an allegedly unfair and flawed process purportedly resulting from alleged conflicts of interest, seeking to complete the sale of Aruba to HP for an allegedly unfair price, and agreeing to allegedly preclusive deal protection devices in the Merger Agreement. The complaint alleges that Aruba, HP, and Merger Sub aided and abetted the individual defendants in the alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties.The complaint further alleges that the defendants disseminated a materially false and misleading proxy statement in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and/or defendants’ fiduciary duties under state law. Among other things, the complaint alleges that the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 17, 2015 omits and/or misrepresents material information concerning the allegedly conflicted and unfair sales process, the allegedly unfair merger consideration, the valuation analyses prepared by Qatalyst, and the anticipated future performance of Aruba. The complaint seeks, among other things, an order declaring that the proposed acquisition is unlawful and unenforceable, an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed acquisition, an order rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement, and attorneys’ fees and costs.

or other nominee. Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

**Q:****What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Aruba?**

**A:**The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Aruba by HP. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby is approved by stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Aruba, with Aruba continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Aruba will become a wholly owned subsidiary of HP, and our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from NASDAQ. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

**Q:****What will I receive if the Merger is completed?**

**A:**Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn or lost your appraisal rights under the DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock, you will receive $2,467.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.

**Q:****How does the Merger Consideration compare to the unaffected market price of the common stock?**

**A:**The relationship of the Merger Consideration to the trading price of the common stock constituted a premium of approximately (i)44% from the average closing price of our common stock in the 30 calendar day period prior to February 24, 2015, the last trading day prior to the date when specific rumors were publicly reported that Aruba and HP were negotiating an acquisition transaction and (ii)34% from the unaffected closing price of our common stock on February 24, 2015.

**Q:****What do I need to do now?**

**A:**We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. **Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card**.

**Q:****Should I send in my stock certificates now?**

**A:**No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send your stock certificates to the paying agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of common stock represented by your stock certificates, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures_”.

**Q:****What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?**

**A:**The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Aruba in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. **Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone**.

**Q:****How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?**

**A:**The Board of Directors, after considering the various factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger — Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger_”, has unanimously (1)determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby are fair to and in the best interests of Aruba’s stockholders; (2)approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (3)directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Aruba for adoption and (4)resolved to recommend that Aruba stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

The Board of Directors recommends that you vote (1)“**FOR**” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (2)“**FOR**” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3)“**FOR**” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

**Q:****What happens if the Merger is not completed?**

**A:**If the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Aruba will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. See the section of this proxy captioned “_The Merger — Effect on Aruba if the Merger is Not Completed_”.

Under specified circumstances, Aruba will be required to pay HP a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement — Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees_”.

**Q:****What constitutes a quorum?**

**A:**Stockholders of Aruba representing a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding common stock of Aruba, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business at such meeting. When a quorum is present to organize a meeting of Aruba stockholders, it is not broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any Aruba stockholders. Abstentions and any broker non-votes are considered as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

**Q:****What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?**

**A:**The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to (1)submit a signed proxy card; (2)grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone; or (3)vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “**AGAINST**” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “**AGAINST**” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “**AGAINST**” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

**Q:****What vote is required to approve any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?**

**A:**Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

The failure of any stockholder of record to (1)submit a signed proxy card; (2)grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone; or (3)vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting, or the approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting, or the approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “**AGAINST**” the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting, or the approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

**Q:****Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote regarding certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?**

**A:**SEC rules require Aruba to seek a non-binding, advisory vote regarding certain compensation that will or may become payable by Aruba to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

**Q:****What is the compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger for purposes of this advisory vote?**

**A:**The compensation that will or may become payable by Aruba to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the Merger and payable to certain of Aruba’s named executive officers. For further detail, see the section in this proxy statement captioned “_Proposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements_”.

**Q:****What will happen if stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Aruba to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger at the Special Meeting?**

**A:**Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Aruba to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is not a condition to completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the compensation that will or may become payable by Aruba to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Aruba or HP. If the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are adopted by the stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that will or may become payable by Aruba to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger may be paid to Aruba’s named executive officers even if stockholders fail to approve the payment of that compensation.

**Q:****Are there any other risks to me from the Merger that I should consider?**

**A:**Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the Merger. For further detail, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “_Forward-Looking Statements_”.

**Q:****What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?**

**A:**If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Aruba.

If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

**Q:****Will my shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?**

**A:**No.For voting purposes, any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares you hold of record, and as a result, any shares held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with shares that you hold of record.Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for the shares held in each such form, because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity.Shares held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing such account.

##### [Index to Financial Statements](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm#INDEX)

**Q:****How may I vote?**

**A:**If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered in your name with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:

•by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;

•by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;

•by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or

•by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot;

A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.

Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of common stock by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of common stock in person by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.

**Q:****If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?**

**A:**No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted against adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, but will have no effect on the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting, or the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

**Q:****May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?**

**A:**Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by:

•signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us in accordance with the instructions therein prior to the Special Meeting;

•submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;

•delivering a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary; or

•attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

##### [Index to Financial Statements](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm#INDEX)

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

**Q:****What is a proxy?**

**A:**A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of common stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a “proxy card.” Michael M. Galvin, our Chief Financial Officer, and Ava M. Hahn, our General Counsel, with full power of substitution, are the proxy holders for the Special Meeting.

**Q:****If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?**

**A:**Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.

If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (1)“**FOR**” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (2)“**FOR**” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3)“**FOR**” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

**Q:****How are votes counted?**

For the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. However, if you “ABSTAIN,” it has the same effect as if you vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. For the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. However if you “ABSTAIN,” it has the same effect as if you vote “AGAINST” the proposals to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you sign and return your proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting and “FOR” the approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you hold your shares in “street name,” follow the instructions from your broker on how to vote your shares. **Please do not send in your share certificates with your proxy card.**

**Q:****What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?**

**A:**Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.

You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.

**Q:****Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?**

**A:**Aruba intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports that Aruba files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “_Where You Can Find More Information_”.

**Q:****Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?**

**A:**If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger_”), the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the Merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger_”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. Federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger_”.

**Q:****What will the holders of Aruba options, restricted stock units and market-stock units receive in the Merger?**

**A:**At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of our common stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a person providing services to us immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become an option with respect to HP common stock and HP will assume each unvested option to purchase shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and the terms of the applicable stock option agreement, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i)HP and its compensation committee will be substituted for the Company and the compensation committee of Aruba’s Board of Directors administering such Company Stock Plans; (ii)each unvested option assumed by HP may be exercised solely for HP common stock (or cash, if permitted under the terms of the applicable unvested option or required under applicable law); (iii)the number of shares of HP common stock subject to the unvested option will be equal to the number of shares of our common stock subject to the option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest

whole share; and (iv)the per share exercise price for each such option will be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each such unvested option by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent. However, any unvested, unexercised and outstanding options to purchase our common stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have a per share exercise price greater than $24.67 will not be assumed by HP and will automatically terminate as of the Effective Time.

At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of our common stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and each former holder of any such cancelled vested option will be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to any applicable withholdings or other taxes, or other amounts as required by law) equal to the product of (1)the total number of outstanding shares of common stock subject to such vested option as of the Effective Time and (2)the amount, if any, by which $24.67 exceeds the exercise price per share of common stock underlying such stock option. Each option with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than $24.67 per share will be cancelled without any cash payment.

At the Effective Time, each award of unvested Restricted Stock Units (including market stock units) granted under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a person providing services to us immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those Restricted Stock Units that will become vested as a result of the consummation of the Merger) will be converted into and become rights with respect to shares of HP common stock and HP will assume the Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plans and/or restricted stock unit agreement as applicable, except that from and after the Effective Time (i)HP and its compensation committee will be substituted for the Company and the compensation committee of Aruba’s Board of Directors administering such Company Stock Plans; (ii)the Restricted Stock Units assumed by HP will represent the right to receive shares of HP common stock (or cash, if permitted under the terms of the applicable Restricted Stock Units or as required by law) upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units promptly after vesting (except to the extent the terms of the applicable Restricted Stock Unit provide for deferred settlement, in which case settlement will be in accordance with the specified terms); and (iii)the number of shares of HP common stock subject to the Restricted Stock Units will equal the number of shares of our common stock subject to the applicable Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and HP will convert any remaining fractional share into the right to receive cash based on the Parent Closing Price.

Pursuant to the individual market stock unit agreements, at the Effective Time, the (i)number of Earned MSUs will be determined by shortening the performance period to end upon the Effective Time and (ii)a participant will vest in the number of Earned MSUs equal to (A)(1) the number of fully completed calendar months that have elapsed from the commencement of the performance period set forth in the market stock unit agreements through the Effective Time, _divided by_ (2)the total number of months in the original performance period (notwithstanding the Merger), _multiplied by_ (B)the Earned MSUs, with the result rounded down to the nearest whole share. The Earned MSUs that vest at the Effective Time will receive the Merger Consideration. The Earned MSUs that do not vest under the individual market stock unit agreements at the Effective Time will be converted into Restricted Stock Units of HP at the Effective Time (with the adjustments described in the paragraph above) and will vest in equal quarterly installments at the end of each three month period following the Effective Time, with the number of quarterly vesting dates equal to (i)(A) the total number of months in the original performance period set forth in the market stock unit agreement (notwithstanding the Merger) _less_ (B)the number of fully completed calendar months that have elapsed from the commencement of the performance period through the Effective Time, _divided by_ (ii)three (rounded down to the nearest whole number). However, 100% of the Earned MSUs that are unvested as of the last day of the original performance period will vest on the last day of the original performance period, unless vested earlier. The market stock units that do not become Earned MSUs will be forfeited at the Effective Time.

**Q: What will happen to the ESPP (as defined below)?**

**A:**Any current offering period as of the date of the Merger Agreement will be the final offering period under the 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer to as the “ESPP”. After the date of the Merger Agreement, no new participants will be permitted to join any current offering period in progress under the ESPP and no ESPP participant will be permitted to increase his or her contributions or the amount of withholding elections with respect to any current offering period. The ESPP will terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall shorten the duration of any then-current offering period under the ESPP and purchase shares of our common stock with all amounts withheld on behalf of the participants. All outstanding shares of our common stock purchased under the ESPP and held by an individual as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled as of the Effective Time and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, and less any applicable withholding taxes. All amounts withheld that have not been used to purchase our common stock at or prior to the Effective Time will be returned to the participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the ESPP upon the termination of the ESPP.

**Q:****When do you expect the Merger to be completed?**

**A:**We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in the second or third quarter of calendar year 2015. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger_”, many of which are outside of our control.

**Q:****If the Merger is completed, how will I receive the cash for my shares?**

**A:**If the Merger is completed and your shares of our common stock are held in book-entry, the paying agent will issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares without any further action on your part. If you are a stockholder of record with your shares held in certificate form, you will receive a letter of transmittal with instructions on how to send your shares of our common stock to the paying agent in connection with the Merger. The paying agent will issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares after you comply with these instructions. **Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.** See the section in this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement — Exchange and Payment Procedures_”.

If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your shares held in “street name”.

**Q:****Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?**

**A:**If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and who properly demand appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262. This means that holders of shares of common stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court. Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement.

**Q:****Do any of Aruba’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that differ from those of Aruba stockholders generally?**

**A:**Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally. In (i)evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii)approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii)recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters.

**[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm)FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This proxy statement, the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement and information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain “forward-looking statements” that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts. You can typically identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words, such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “project,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “potential,” “plan,” “forecast” and other words of similar import. Stockholders are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and the following factors:

•the inability to complete the Merger due to the failure to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval or failure to satisfy the other conditions to the completion of the Merger, including the receipt of regulatory approvals from various domestic and foreign governmental entities (including any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed on these approvals) and the risk that one or more governmental entities may deny approval;

•the risk that the Merger Agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay HP a termination fee of $90 million;

•the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and others related to the Merger Agreement;

•risks that the proposed Merger disrupts our current operations or affects our ability to retain or recruit key employees or diverts management’s or employees’ attention from ongoing business operations;

•the fact that receipt of the all-cash Merger Consideration would be taxable to stockholders that are treated as U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

•the fact that, if the Merger is completed, stockholders will forgo the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the successful execution of Aruba’s current strategy as an independent company;

•the possibility that HP could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including restructuring efforts, special dividends or the sale of some or all of Aruba’s assets to one or more as yet unknown purchasers, that could conceivably produce a higher aggregate value than that available to stockholders in the Merger;

•the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Aruba is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals during the pendency of the Merger;

•the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on our business relationships, operating results and business generally;

•the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger; and

•risks that our stock price may decline significantly if the Merger is not completed.

Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this proxy statement are qualified by the information contained or incorporated by reference herein, including (1)the information contained under this caption; and (2)the information contained under the caption “Risk Factors” and information in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. No assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking statements.

Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Stockholders are advised to consult any future disclosures that we make on related subjects as may be detailed in our other filings made from time to time with the SEC.

If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by Aruba’s stockholders is a condition to the closing of the Merger.

Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, if a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “**AGAINST**” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. For stockholders who attend the meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “**AGAINST**” any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger

Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting and “**AGAINST**” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “**AGAINST**” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, but will have no effect on (i)any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting or (ii)the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares. “Broker non-votes,” if any, will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.

You will be entitled to one vote per share for each share of common stock you owned on the Record Date.

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 3,019,752 shares of common stock, representing approximately 2.75% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the Record Date. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote, and Mr.Orr and Mr.Melkote have entered into the Voting Agreement obligating them to vote, all of their shares of common stock (1)“**FOR**” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (2)“**FOR**” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3)“**FOR**” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you may cause your shares to be voted by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid envelope, or you may vote in person at the Special Meeting. Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone. Based on your proxy cards or Internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will vote your shares according to your directions.

If you plan to attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the Special Meeting. If your shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person. If you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.

Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted (1)“**FOR**” adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (2)“**FOR**” the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3)“**FOR**” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or attending the Special Meeting and voting in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee. If such a service is provided, you may vote over the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if possible, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have the same effect as if you voted “**AGAINST**” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, but will not have any effect on the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting or the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

If you are a stockholder of record on the Record Date, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by:

•signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;

•submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;

•delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or

•attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you have submitted a proxy, your appearance at the Special Meeting, in the absence of voting in person or submitting an additional proxy or revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Any adjournment, postponement or other delay of the Special Meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, will allow stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Special Meeting as adjourned, postponed or delayed.

The Board of Directors, after considering various factors described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger — Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger_”, has unanimously (1)determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby are fair to and in the best interests of Aruba’s stockholders; (2)approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (3)directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Aruba for adoption and (4)resolved to recommend that Aruba stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by Aruba. We have retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated, a proxy solicitation firm, which we refer to as the “Proxy Solicitor”, to solicit proxies in connection with the Special Meeting at a cost of $25,000 plus expenses. We will also indemnify the Proxy Solicitor against losses arising out of its provisions of these services on our behalf. In addition, we may reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers and employees, personally or by telephone, email, fax, over the Internet or other means of communication. No additional compensation will be paid for such services.

Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by stockholders of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, we anticipate that the Merger will be consummated in the second or third quarter of calendar year 2015.

**[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm)Appraisal Rights**

If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, who continuously hold their shares of common stock through the Effective Time, and who properly demand appraisal of their shares of common stock in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 are entitled to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262. This means that holders of shares of common stock who may exercise appraisal rights and who also have properly exercised and not lost such appraisal rights are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, so long as such holders comply exactly with the procedures established by Section 262.

**Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of common stock are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the Merger Consideration.**

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL, including (i)delivering a written demand for appraisal to Aruba before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (ii)not submitting a proxy or otherwise voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; and (iii)continuing to hold your shares of common stock of record through the Effective Time. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such bank, brokerage firm or nominee. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and Section 262 regarding appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.

We are asking you to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the Merger Agreement and the Merger throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the sections captioned “The Merger” and “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. You are urged to read the Merger Agreement carefully in its entirety.

Under applicable law, we cannot complete the Merger without the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, or fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting. If stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.

**The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.**

**CERTAIN MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS**

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the payment of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers by Aruba in connection with the Merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger — Interests of Aruba’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger— Payments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control_.”

We are asking stockholders to indicate their approval of the various compensation that will or may become payable by Aruba to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger — Interests of Aruba’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute Compensation_” and the accompanying footnotes. In general, the various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made have previously formed part of Aruba’s overall compensation program for our named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to stockholders as part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related sections of our annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of non-management directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms. The compensation that may be provided to two of the named executive officers in connection with new employment agreements entered into with HP is not subject to this advisory, non-binding vote.

Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Aruba Networks, Inc. approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers by Aruba that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger — Interests of Aruba’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Payments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control” in Aruba’s proxy statement for the Special Meeting._”

Stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and as an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Aruba, the Board of Directors or HP. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.

**The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.**

**_Aruba Networks, Inc._**

Aruba is a leading global provider of enterprise mobility solutions. Aruba develops, markets and sells products and services that help solve its customers’ secure mobility requirements through its Mobility-Defined Networks, a network architecture designed to automatically optimize infrastructure-wide performance and trigger security actions that previously required manual intervention by IT departments. Aruba Mobility-Defined Networks are comprised of the following three major components: Aruba’s mobility-centric network infrastructure, Aruba’s ClearPass Access Management System, and Aruba’s mobility applications. Aruba’s goal is to provide simplified, dependable solutions that enable IT departments to quickly, securely and cost-effectively meet their mobility and bring-your-own-device needs. Aruba’s Mobility-Defined Networks are designed for the all-wireless workplace and an increasingly mobile universe of end-users, who Aruba refers to as GenMobile, who rely on mobile devices for nearly every aspect of their work life and personal communication. Aruba derives its revenue primarily from sales of Mobility Controllers with ArubaOS operating system software, controller-less and controller-managed wireless access points, value-added security software modules, access management system solutions, multi-vendor management software, mobility management solutions and other software, Mobility Access Switches, and support and professional services. Aruba has offices in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions and employs staff around the world.

Aruba’s common stock is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “ARUN”.

Aruba’s principal executive office is located at 1344 Crossman Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089 and its telephone number is (408)227-4500.

**_HP Company_**

HP, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, is a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors.

HP’s principal executive office is located at 3000 Hanover Street, Palo Alto, California 94304 and its telephone number is (650)857-1501.

**_Aspen Acquisition Sub, Inc._**

Aspen Acquisition Sub, Inc. is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of HP and was formed on February 25, 2015, solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and has not engaged in any business activities other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

owned subsidiary of HP. As a result of the Merger, Aruba will become a wholly owned subsidiary of HP, and our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from NASDAQ. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

The Effective Time will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as is agreed upon in writing by HP and Aruba and specified in the certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL.

**[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm)Effect on Aruba if the Merger is Not Completed**

If the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Aruba’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Aruba will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we expect that management will operate the business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in which Aruba operates and risks related to adverse economic conditions.

Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the price of our common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of common stock. If the Merger is not completed, the Board of Directors will continue to evaluate and review Aruba’s business operations, strategic direction and capitalization, among other things, and will make such changes as are deemed appropriate. If the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Board of Directors will be offered or that Aruba’s business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.

In addition, Aruba will be required to pay to HP a termination fee of $90 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances. For more information please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement — Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees_.”

At the Effective Time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any shares resulting from the settlement of restricted stock units which become vested as a result of the consummation of the Merger, but excluding excluded shares and dissenting shares, each as defined below) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $24.67 in cash, without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax. As of the Effective Time, all shares of our common stock will be cancelled and will thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with, and subject to, the conditions of the Merger Agreement. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock held in the treasury of Aruba or owned, directly or indirectly, by HP or Merger Sub, which we refer to as “excluded shares”, will be automatically canceled without payment of any consideration. In addition, each share of common stock held by stockholders who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL, which we refer to as “dissenting shares”, will not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, unless and until such stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such stockholder’s right to appraisal under Section 262, at which time each such share of common stock will be

The Board of Directors regularly evaluates Aruba’s strategic direction and ongoing business plan with a view toward strengthening its core business and expanding the diversity of its product options in core regions and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the Board of Directors has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives for Aruba, including the continuation of Aruba’s business plan as a standalone enterprise, modifications to Aruba’s strategy and product direction and a possible sale of Aruba.

On August 26, 2014, following the close of NASDAQ, Aruba announced its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014 results, which were higher than previous guidance and which reflected strong fourth quarter performance, including bookings growth in major markets, with particular strength in North America and solid year-over-year growth in its core verticals.

On August 27, 2014, Antonio Neri, Senior Vice President and General Manager, HP Servers and HP Networking Global Business Units, called Dominic Orr, the President, CEO and Chairman of Aruba to express interest in the acquisition of Aruba by HP. Mr.Orr then notified Daniel Warmenhoven, the lead independent director of the Board of Directors, of his call with Mr.Neri. Following a discussion with Mr.Orr, Mr.Warmenhoven called a representative of Qatalyst Partners to discuss the situation in the event that Aruba might require a financial advisor on short notice.

On September 1, 2014, Messrs. Neri and Orr met to discuss a potential acquisition transaction. Mr.Neri did not suggest a proposed price, but he indicated that HP was very interested in pursuing such a transaction because of the potential synergies.

On September 2, 2014, Mr.Warmenhoven spoke with Meg Whitman, the Chief Executive Officer of HP, to confirm that HP was, in fact, interested in a potential strategic transaction with Aruba and that Mr.Neri had been properly authorized by HP to contact Mr.Orr regarding such potential transaction. During that call, Ms.Whitman confirmed HP’s interest and that Mr.Neri was properly authorized.

Later on Tuesday, September 2, 2014, the Board of Directors convened a special meeting so that Mr.Orr could provide the Board of Directors with information regarding his conversations with Mr.Neri. The Board of Directors also authorized management to seek to engage a financial advisor at this meeting.

On September 5, 2014, at the direction of the Board of Directors and in preparation for consideration of a possible offer from HP, Aruba engaged Qatalyst Partners as its financial advisor.

On September 10, 2014, at a regular meeting of the Board of Directors with representatives of both Qatalyst Partners and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, which we refer to as “WSGR”, in attendance, Mr.Orr described his recent conversations with HP regarding the potential strategic transaction. Mr.Orr noted that HP had expressed interest in expanding its networking business and that Mr.Neri indicated that an acquisition of Aruba would provide HP with a platform for future growth and development in that sector. Mr.Orr also noted that representatives of HP had indicated that they were evaluating several targets for a potential strategic acquisition and that these potential targets would be discussed with HP’s board of directors in late September. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then discussed with the Board of Directors background financial information regarding the Company and next steps that could be undertaken in preparation for evaluating any specific acquisition proposals that the Company might receive. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners led a preliminary discussion of third parties that might reasonably have the interest and capability to consider a transaction with Aruba. Following questions and discussion by the Board of

Directors, including potential responses to HP, the Board of Directors directed Mr.Orr to inform HP that the Board of Directors had made no determination to sell Aruba, but that the Board of Directors was amenable to further dialogue regarding a potential strategic transaction. After this meeting, senior executives of Aruba and HP spoke regarding potential next steps.

On September 15, 2014, Messrs. Neri and Orr discussed whether Aruba could use the HP platform to become a stronger competitor. The parties agreed that certain members of management should meet and discuss potential synergies.

On September 17, 2014, HP provided Aruba with an initial high-level due diligence list and a proposed management presentation agenda. Aruba sent HP a draft confidentiality agreement in order to facilitate further discussions. Also on September 17, 2014, members of management and representatives of WSGR had an introductory call with HP to discuss scheduling management meetings and initial diligence processes. Ava Hahn, Aruba’s General Counsel, indicated to HP that execution of the confidentiality agreement was a prerequisite to any such meetings.

On September 18, 2014, Messrs Orr and Neri had a call to discuss the meeting of the HP board of directors regarding a potential transaction with Aruba, which had occurred on September 17, 2014. Mr.Neri indicated that the HP board was supportive of continuing to explore a potential transaction. The parties also discussed management meeting attendees and the logistics of the meetings.

On September 23, 2014, senior executives of Aruba and HP met in person to further discuss the proposed potential combination and strategic rationale for the transaction.

On September 25, 2014, at a special meeting of the Board of Directors attended by senior executive officers of Aruba and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, the Board of Directors directed Qatalyst Partners to reach out to a select group of other potential strategic acquirors to solicit preliminary indications of interest and gauge their interest in pursuing a potential acquisition of Aruba. The Board of Directors instructed Aruba management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners to focus their outreach to a limited number of strategic parties with financial wherewithal and a strategic interest in mobile technology, with whom the Board of Directors believed Aruba would have the most compelling synergies and would thus be competitive with any potential proposal from HP. The Board of Directors determined to not contact any private equity firms because of the Board’s belief that, given Aruba’s volatile revenues and unpredictable cash flows and the potential for synergies between Aruba’s businesses with a strategic acquiror, private equity firms would not be competitive in their potential valuations.

At the direction of the Board of Directors, between September 29, 2014 and October 2, 2014, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with senior executives of five potential strategic acquirors. Party 1 was contacted on September 29, 2014 and, on that date, declined to proceed with evaluating a potential acquisition of the Company. Party 2 was contacted on September 30, 2014, Party 3 was contacted on October 1, 2014 and Parties 4 and 5 were contacted on October 2, 2014. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided regular updates to the Board of Directors regarding the status of the outreach process.

On October 2, 2014, following negotiations between Aruba and HP, the parties entered into a confidentiality agreement with a customary standstill provision, which we refer to as the “Confidentiality Agreement”.

Later on October 2, 2014, management of Aruba and HP met in person to discuss the potential strategic transaction. The meetings included presentations by Aruba management to key members of the HP finance, engineering, channel, and corporate development teams, which included non-public information on Aruba’s ongoing strategy and vision, its product roadmap, its go-to-market strategy, its financials, financial projections provided by management, and potential synergies that may result from a transaction. Representatives from Aruba included Mr.Orr, Keerti Melkote, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer, Michael Galvin, Chief Financial Officer, Greg Murphy, Vice President Business Operations, Aaron Bean, Vice President, Human Resources, and Ms.Hahn.

On October 3, 2014, Party 4 informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it was declining to engage in evaluating a potential acquisition of Aruba.

On October 5, 2014, Mr.Neri contacted Mr.Orr and informed him that the October 2 meetings had increased HP’s interest in the potential transaction and that the product roadmap presented by Mr.Melkote indicated greater synergies than HP’s prior assessment. Mr.Neri also told Mr.Orr that he was keeping Ms.Whitman apprised of the parties’ progress.

On October 6, 2014, Party 2 informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it was declining to engage in evaluating a potential acquisition of Aruba.

Also on October 6, 2014, HP announced publicly that it was contemplating a spin-off transaction. In the potential spin-off, its enterprise business, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, would be separated from its consumer business, HP Inc. Representatives of HP contacted Aruba’s management, including Mr.Orr and Ms.Hahn, to assure Aruba that, despite its announcement, HP remained focused on the potential acquisition of Aruba and considered it important for the future growth of the enterprise business following the separation.

On October 7, 2014, HP provided a list of due diligence questions regarding products and technology, sales and marketing, customers, support and services, financials and legal matters to follow up on from the October 2, 2014 management meetings and requested phone calls with specific members of Aruba management.

On October 8, 2014, Party 5 informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it was declining to engage in evaluating an acquisition of Aruba.

On October 9, 2014, Party 3 informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it was declining to engage in evaluating an acquisition of Aruba.

From October 8, 2014 through October 13, 2013, HP and Aruba conducted a series of calls with Aruba management regarding products and technology, sales and marketing, customers, support and services, financials, and legal matters.

On October 16, 2014, at the request of Mr.Orr, who desired to better understand HP’s go-to-market strategy and to discuss potential synergies, Messrs Orr and Murphy, Ms.Hahn, Joakim Johansson, the Vice President of Corporate Development at HP, Monique Nolk, the Vice President of Strategy and Operations at HP Networking and Matt Greenly, the CFO& Vice President, HP Servers and Networking, met to further discuss the potential strategic transaction. Parties in attendance at the meeting also discussed the follow-up diligence requests previously provided by HP.

On October 21, 2014, Mr.Orr met with Mr.Neri to further discuss the potential strategic transaction. At this meeting, Mr.Neri indicated that HP would need two to three more weeks to put an offer together.

On October 27, 2014, Aruba and HP held a call to discuss HP’s diligence and evaluation process.

On November 3, 2014, the parties met to discuss the progress of discussions regarding the strategic transaction at HP. HP informed Aruba that it planned to bring the proposed strategic transaction to its board of directors at its meeting on November 19, 2014 and that it expected to be able to provide a proposal regarding the proposed transaction following that meeting.

On November 20, 2014, after the close of NASDAQ, Aruba announced its first quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results and provided guidance for the second quarter of its 2015 fiscal year that were below the consensus street estimate.

On November 24, 2014, Mr.Neri informed Mr.Orr that HP’s board had indicated that they wanted HP’s management to prepare additional financial analyses regarding the proposed Aruba transaction and that HP would require an additional two to three weeks to address the HP board’s questions. Mr.Orr informed Mr.Warmenhoven of HP’s request and, after internal discussion, Aruba determined that it would suspend discussions with HP.

On November 25, 2014, Mr.Orr called Mr.Neri to inform Mr.Neri that Aruba was suspending the discussions regarding an acquisition transaction after concluding that three months of discussions was sufficient time and that, given the absence of any formal or informal proposals regarding price from HP, Aruba should continue to execute on its standalone operating plan. Mr. Orr also updated the Board of Directors on this recommended course of action.

On December 5, 2014, at a regular meeting of the Board of Directors attended by representatives of WSGR, Mr.Orr updated the Board of Directors on his conversation with Mr.Neri on November 25, 2014. The Board of Directors agreed that suspending discussions with HP at this juncture was the appropriate course of action.

By December 31, 2014, the trading price of Aruba’s stock had experienced an overall decline to $18.18 per share at market close on December 31, 2014. In late December 2014, Mr.Neri called Mr.Orr and informed him that Ms.Whitman had invited Mr.Orr to dinner, but did not provide a purpose for the dinner meeting.

On January 21, 2015, as a follow up to the late December invitation, Messrs. Orr and Neri had a dinner meeting with Ms.Whitman at which the parties reopened discussions regarding a strategic transaction and the strategic potentials of an HP acquisition of Aruba.

On January 27, 2015, at a special meeting of the Board of Directors attended by representatives of WSGR, Mr.Orr provided a summary of the discussions with Ms.Whitman on January 21, 2015. Messrs. Orr and Warmenhoven also discussed the possibility of retaining an additional financial advisor in connection with the discussions with HP if the Board of Directors elected to move forward with the proposed transaction. After discussion, the Board of Directors authorized the retention of Evercore Group L.L.C., which we refer to as “Evercore”, based on its experience, reputation and other factors, including that it has no material commercial relationships with HP.

In late January 2015, a representative of Qatalyst Partners had an informal conversation with an executive at Party 6 on matters unrelated to a sale of Aruba. During their conversation, the representative of Qatalyst Partners inferred that Party 6 might be interested in a strategic transaction with Aruba. The representative of Qatalyst Partners then informed Mr.Warmenhoven.

On January 30, 2015, representatives of Qatalyst Partners reached out to a senior executive of Party 6, a potential strategic acquiror, to assess its interest in a potential acquisition of the Company.

On January 31, 2015, Aruba’s second quarter of fiscal year 2015 ended.

On January 31, 2015, Aruba received a non-binding letter of intent from HP proposing an acquisition price of $23.25 per share in cash. This price represented a premium of approximately 35% to the 30-day trailing average trading price of Aruba’s stock. The proposal was subject to satisfactory completion of confirmatory due diligence, negotiation of a mutually acceptable definitive transaction document, the final approval of the transaction by HP’s board and other customary transaction conditions, but was not subject to any third party financing condition.

Later on January 31, 2015, at a special meeting of the Board of Directors attended by representatives of WSGR and Qatalyst Partners, respectively, the Board of Directors discussed the non-binding letter of intent from HP. Mr.Orr provided a summary of his telephone calls with representative of HP regarding the letter of intent.

Representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed with the Board of Directors financial aspects of the proposal. Representatives of WSGR discussed with the Board of Directors legal aspects of the proposal. Following the departure of the representatives of Qatalyst Partners from the meeting, the Board of Directors resolved to engage Evercore to act as an additional financial advisor to Aruba.

On February 1, 2015, Aruba engaged Evercore as an additional financial advisor in connection with the discussions with HP.

On February 2, 2015, at a special meeting of the Board of Directors at the offices of WSGR attended by representatives of WSGR, Qatalyst Partners and Evercore, Mr.Galvin presented a preliminary review of Aruba’s financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 and presented financial projections prepared by management. The Board of Directors provided Mr.Galvin with feedback regarding the items presented. Also on February 2, 2015, Party 6 informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it was declining to engage in evaluating an acquisition of Aruba. No inbound inquiries were received by Aruba regarding a potential transaction from the time of the re-initiation of discussions with HP until the time of entry into the Merger Agreement, nor did Aruba have any substantive discussions with any other parties regarding the sale of its business.

On February 4, 2015, at a special meeting of the Board of Directors attended by representatives of WSGR, Evercore and Qatalyst Partners, the Board of Directors reviewed HP’s January 31 proposal. WSGR reviewed the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties in connection with its receipt of the proposal from HP. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Evercore each discussed with the Board of Directors financial aspects of the HP proposal. The Board of Directors discussed the proposal with a focus on how the proposal compared to Aruba’s standalone financial plan in terms of maximizing stockholder value. Representatives of Qatalyst and Evercore, respectively, then discussed with the Board of Directors the manner in which to respond to HP with respect to its proposal. Following such discussions, the Board of Directors authorized representatives of Evercore to present a counter-proposal to HP of $29.00 per share in cash.

Later on February 4, 2015, Evercore presented the counter-proposal to Barclays Capital Inc., financial advisor to HP, which we refer to as “Barclays”, which informed Evercore verbally that it believed $29.00 per share was significantly higher than the price at which HP was prepared to transact, but that the counter-proposal would be presented to HP.

On February 5 and 6, 2015, Evercore held short update calls with the Board of Directors to inform Aruba that no response had been received from Barclays and HP, but that it had been informed that HP was having internal discussions. HP’s non-binding indication of interest was set to expire on February 6, 2015. Late on the night of February 6, 2015, Barclays reached out to Evercore to request a call for the following morning.

On February 7, 2015, Evercore had a call with Barclays, who informed Evercore that its client was of the view that there was a significant disconnect as to the value of Aruba and the potential synergies that would be provided by the proposed acquisition. Barclays communicated to Evercore that it had conducted extensive analysis of the value of Aruba generally and to HP specifically and that, while there might be an increase in price per share in a revised proposal, the increase would be in the context of “quarters, not dollars.” Barclays also emphasized the importance of the timing of the transaction and the need to determine sooner, rather than later, whether agreement could be reached on the value of Aruba, particularly in light of the separation transaction involving Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Evercore responded that regardless of differing views as to value, if Barclays had a new price per share to propose, it should provide a formal proposal so that it could be evaluated by the Board of Directors and its advisors.

On February 8, 2015, Barclays communicated to Evercore verbally that there would be a proposal at approximately $24.00 per share, but no written letter of intent was provided. In response to the informal proposal, Evercore advocated that a higher price per share was warranted.

In the first week of February, the trading price of Aruba’s stock remained less than $17.00 per share and, on February 6, 2015, the trading price of Aruba stock closed at $16.33 per share.

On February 9, 2015, Barclays informed Evercore that a proposal would be made at $24.67 per share in cash, which represented an approximately 51% premium to the closing price of Aruba’s common stock on February 6, 2015, but no letter of intent was provided. A special meeting of the Board of Directors was called that same day and the Board of Directors instructed management to go back to senior executives at HP to propose a per share price of $25.00.

Later on February 9, 2015, HP submitted a revised written proposal to the Company at a price of $24.67 per share in cash, asserting in such written proposal that the price was its “best and final” offer. HP indicated that there would be no third party financing or funding conditions and no requirement for approval by HP shareholders, but that the offer was contingent on entry by HP and Aruba into a 30-day exclusivity agreement.

On February 10, 2015, the Board of Directors convened a special meeting to discuss the letter of intent. Representatives of Evercore described the negotiations with Barclays over the past few days. The Board of Directors discussed the solicitation process undertaken by its financial advisors, in which six of the strategic acquirors that presented the strongest strategic fit with Aruba had all declined to explore an acquisition transaction. The Board of Directors also discussed the recent weakness in the Aruba share price. The Board of Directors discussed the potential upside inherent in successfully executing on the “Aruba 2.0” strategy which management had proposed to the Board of Directors as its going-forward strategy as a stand-alone company, together with the risks inherent in executing on such a strategy. The “Aruba 2.0” strategy, which contemplated both a continued emphasis on growing core areas and a transformative shift in product focus, consisted of continuing 20-25% year-over-year growth, focusing on premium WLAN for enterprise customers, maintaining strong margins for Aruba’s WLAN platform, integrating go-to-market teams and executing on cloud architecture in conjunction with a move to software subscriptions to capture recurring revenue. The Board of Directors then discussed whether to make a counter-offer to HP again at the $25.00 per share price in light of the fact that HP had characterized its proposal as its “best and final” offer. After discussion, the Board of Directors concluded that $24.67 per share in cash was a compelling offer for Aruba and authorized its management to enter into an exclusivity agreement with HP and commence negotiations on that basis.

On February 11, 2015, HP and Aruba entered into a 30-day exclusivity agreement which would terminate by its terms on March 13, 2015. Later on February 11, 2015, Aruba gave representatives of HP access to a virtual data room for the purposes of continued due diligence.

On or around February 13, 2015, representatives of HP requested an amendment to the Confidentiality Agreement to remove a provision prohibiting discussions regarding employee solicitations, in order to give HP the ability to negotiate employment-related matters.

On February 14, 2015, representatives of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, which we refer to as “Gibson Dunn”, counsel to HP, delivered a draft of the Merger Agreement to representatives of WSGR. Over the course of the next two weeks, counsel for the two parties, together with management from both parties, negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement, with significant focus on deal protection measures, including the size of the termination fee potentially payable, regulatory approvals, closing certainty and other matters.

From February 15, 2015 through March 1, 2015, HP management engaged in detailed follow up due diligence with Aruba, including meetings between members of management of Aruba and HP, which included presentations on sales and marketing, product and technology, finance, accounting, tax and human resources.

On February 18, 2015, at a special meeting of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors authorized management to enter into an amendment to the Confidentiality Agreement to remove a provision prohibiting discussions regarding employee solicitations, which we refer to as the “Confidentiality Agreement Amendment”.

Later on February 18, 2015, the parties entered into the Confidentiality Agreement Amendment.

On February 19, 2015, senior executives of both parties and an Evercore representative met to discuss timing and feasibility of the proposed transaction.

On February 24, 2015, Aruba was contacted by a reporter for Bloomberg Business requesting confirmation that HP was engaging in negotiations regarding a sale of Aruba to HP. Aruba declined to comment.

Early in the day on February 25, 2015, Bloomberg Business published a news article, which we refer to as the “Bloomberg report”, reporting that HP and Aruba were conducting talks regarding a potential acquisition of Aruba by HP. Following the Bloomberg report, the trading price of Aruba stock experienced a marked increase of 21% from $18.38 per share to $22.24 per share.

On February 26, 2015, Aruba stock closed at a trading price of $22.61 per share. After market close, Aruba released its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2015, indicating year-over-year growth of 21% and record revenue of $212.9 million.

Recognizing that, consistent with the unusual rise in stock price and trading volume in the days following the Bloomberg report, on February 27, 2015, Aruba’s stock had been trading above the negotiated deal price and that the trading price of Aruba’s stock at the close of market was $24.81, the Board of Directors held a special meeting to determine whether to proceed with the proposed strategic transaction. At the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed with the Board of Directors the financial aspects of the HP proposal and the Company’s earnings release and recent trading information regarding the Company and other companies in its industry in the immediate aftermath of their respective earnings announcements. The Board of Directors further discussed whether the positive earnings results altered its perception of the fundamentals of Aruba’s business. After discussion, the Board of Directors determined that its conclusion about the favorability of the $24.67 per share price relative to the fundamental financial metrics of Aruba had not changed. The Board of Directors then debated whether to insist on an upward adjustment to the purchase price to $25.00 per share in light of the higher market price. After discussion, it was decided that because the higher trading price was primarily being driven by market speculation of a transaction, and not by changes in the fundamentals of the business, HP would be unlikely to raise the transaction pricing in light of such market movements. The Board of Directors believed that, given the low likelihood of obtaining a higher per share price, Aruba should focus on obtaining a lower termination fee and increased commitment from HP on efforts to seek regulatory approvals. Following the Board of Directors’ decision to proceed with the proposed transaction, representatives of WSGR and Gibson Dunn had several discussions during the period from February 28, 2015 to March 1, 2015 to finalize the remaining open terms of the Merger Agreement, disclosure schedules and voting agreement. The last two remaining issues in the Merger Agreement, which were heavily negotiated among the parties before agreement, were the size of the termination fee and covenants related to efforts to consummate the transaction.

On March 1, 2015, the Board of Directors convened a special meeting to consider the terms of the proposed strategic transaction. Also in attendance were members of Aruba’s management and representatives of WSGR, Qatalyst Partners and Evercore. Evercore reviewed the negotiations with Barclays. Representatives of WSGR reviewed the key terms of the Merger Agreement and described changes to the Merger Agreement, which had been finalized with Gibson Dunn earlier that day. WSGR also reviewed the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties. The Board of Directors also discussed its view that the proposed price of $24.67 per share in cash was fair to the Company’s stockholders.

heading “—Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger”), the Board of Directors unanimously (i)determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby were fair to and in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders, (ii)approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (iii)directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Aruba for adoption and (iv)resolved to recommend that Aruba’s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Board of Directors also adopted a resolution authorizing an amendment to Aruba’s bylaws to provide that Delaware courts would be the exclusive forum for certain types of claims relating to the Company.

Later on March 1, 2015, after the Board of Directors approved the transaction, representatives of HP presented Messrs.Orr and Melkote with draft employment agreements. Later that night and into the early morning of March 2, 2015, representatives of Messrs.Orr and Melkote negotiated and entered into employment agreements with HP for each of Mr.Orr and Mr.Melkote.

Following the meeting of the Board of Directors and the execution of the employment agreements with Messrs.Orr and Melkote, in the early hours of March 2, 2015, the parties executed the Merger Agreement and Voting Agreement. Following the execution of the Merger Agreement, the parties issued a joint press release announcing the transaction.

**_Recommendation of the Board of Directors_**

The Board of Directors has unanimously (1)determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Aruba and its stockholders; and (2)adopted and approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1)“FOR” the adoption the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (2)“FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3)“FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may become payable by Aruba to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

**_Reasons for the Merger_**

In evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors consulted with Aruba management, and representatives of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel. In recommending that stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby the Board of Directors considered a number of factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):

•The fact that the all-cash Merger Consideration will provide certainty of value and liquidity to stockholders, while eliminating the effect of long-term business and execution risk to stockholders.

•The relationship of the $24.67 Merger consideration to the trading price of the common stock, including that the Merger Consideration constituted a premium of approximately (i)44% from the average closing price of Aruba’s common stock in the 30 calendar day period prior to February 24, 2015, the last trading day prior to the Bloomberg report on February 25, 2015 and (ii)34% from the unaffected closing price of Aruba’s common stock on February 24, 2015.

•The recent and historical market prices of Aruba’s common stock.

•Its belief, based on discussions and negotiations with HP, that $24.67 per share was the highest price HP would be willing to pay.

•The thorough review of Aruba’s strategic and financial alternatives, including that:

•representatives of Aruba’s financial advisors contacted a total of six strategic buyers in an effort to obtain the best value reasonably available to stockholders and each declined to proceed with an evaluation of a potential strategic transaction;

•its belief that it was unlikely that another party would be willing to pay more than $24.67 in cash; and

•the absence of any substantive inbound inquiries with respect to a potential strategic transaction between the Bloomberg report on February 25, 2015, and the announcement of the transaction.

•The multiples to revenues and net operating profit after tax implied by the $24.67 Merger Consideration.

•The oral opinion of Qatalyst Partners, subsequently confirmed in writing, respectively, delivered to the Board of Directors that, as of March 1, 2015 and based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions, considerations, limitations and other matters set forth in its opinion, the $24.67 Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of our common stock, other than HP or any affiliates of HP, pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as more fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “— _Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP_”.

•The terms of the Merger Agreement and the related agreements, including:

•Aruba’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals;

•Aruba’s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a Superior Proposal, subject to HP’s ability to match such Superior Proposal and subject to paying HP a termination fee of $90 million and other conditions of the Merger Agreement;

•The fact that the Board of Directors believed that the termination fee of $90 million is reasonable and not preclusive of other offers;

•Aruba’s entitlement to specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement;

•That the Merger is subject to the approval of a majority of the outstanding stock of the Company; and

•The Board of Directors’ view that the Merger Agreement was the product of arms’-length negotiation and contained customary terms and conditions.

•The Board of Directors’ understanding of Aruba’s business and operations, and its current and historical results of operations, financial prospects and condition.

•The perceived risk of continuing as an independent public company or pursuing other alternatives, including (1)the continuation of Aruba’s business plan as an independent enterprise; (2)modifications to Aruba’s strategy and product direction, including the execution on the “Aruba 2.0” business plan; (3)potential expansion opportunities into new business lines through acquisitions and combinations of Aruba with other businesses; and (4)potential divestitures of one or more product lines.

•The competitive landscape and the dynamics of the market for Aruba’s products and technology; and the assessment that other alternatives were not reasonably likely to create greater value for stockholders than the Merger, taking into account execution risk as well as business, competitive, industry and market risk.

•The Board of Directors’ view that the terms of the Merger Agreement would be unlikely to deter interested third parties from making a Superior Proposal, including the Merger Agreement’s terms and

conditions as they relate to changes in the recommendation of the Board of Directors and the belief that the termination fee potentially payable to HP is reasonable in light of the circumstances, consistent with or below fees in comparable transactions and not preclusive of other offers (see the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement — Other Covenants Under the Merger Agreement — Alternative Acquisition Proposals; Change in the Recommendation of Aruba’s Board of Directors_”).

The Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):

•the risks and costs to Aruba if the Merger does not close, including the diversion of management and employee attention, and the potential effect on our business and relationships with customers and suppliers;

•the fact that stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of Aruba and will not benefit from any appreciation in value of Aruba, including any appreciation in value that could be realized as a result of improvements to our operations, including the recent restructuring;

•the requirement that Aruba pay HP a termination fee of $90 million under certain circumstances following termination of the Merger Agreement, including if the Board of Directors terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal;

•the restrictions on the conduct of Aruba’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, including the requirement that we conduct our business in the ordinary course, subject to specific limitations, which may delay or prevent Aruba from undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the Merger and that, absent the Merger Agreement, Aruba might have pursued;

•the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to Aruba’s stockholders that are U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

•the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Aruba is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals during the pendency of the Merger;

•the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger and the substantial time and effort of Aruba management required to complete the Merger, which may disrupt our business operations;

•the fact that Aruba’s business, sales operations and financial results could suffer in the event that the Merger is not consummated;

•the risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of termination of the Merger Agreement on the trading price of our common stock;

•the fact that the completion of the Merger will require antitrust clearance in the United States and certain other countries;

•the fact that Aruba’s directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Aruba’s other stockholders (see below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_— Interests of Aruba’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger_”); and

•the fact that the announcement and pendency of the Merger, or the failure to complete the Merger, may cause substantial harm to Aruba’s relationships with its employees (including making it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel and the possible loss of key management, technical, sales and other personnel), vendors and customers and may divert employees’ attention away from Aruba’s day-to-day business operations.

The foregoing discussion is not meant to be exhaustive, but summarizes many, if not all, of the material factors considered by the Board of Directors in its consideration of the Merger. After considering these and other factors, the Board of Directors concluded that the potential benefits of the Merger outweighed the uncertainties

and risks. In view of the variety of factors considered by the Board of Directors and the complexity of these factors, the Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its determination and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Board of Directors applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different weights to different factors. The Board of Directors unanimously adopted and approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and recommends that stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby based upon the totality of the information presented to and considered by the Board of Directors.

Aruba has agreed to pay Evercore for its services as a financial adviser to Aruba in connection with the Merger a success fee in an amount equal to 0.25% of the transaction value, or approximately $7.4 million. The success fee is payable at, and contingent upon, consummation of the Merger. Aruba has also agreed to reimburse Evercore for its reasonable out-of-pocket third party expenses incurred in connection with Evercore’s engagement and has agreed to indemnify Evercore and its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses arising out of or in connection with Evercore’s engagement.

During the two year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship has existed between Evercore and its affiliates, on the one hand, and either HP or Aruba or any of their respective affiliates, on the other hand, pursuant to which compensation was received or is intended to be received by Evercore or its affiliates as a result of such a relationship, and no such relationship is mutually understood to be contemplated.

Evercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for their own accounts and the accounts of customers. In connection with these businesses or otherwise, Evercore and its affiliates and/or their respective employees, as well as investment funds in which any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products relating to Aruba and its respective affiliates.

Aruba engaged Evercore to act as its financial advisor based on its qualifications, experience and reputation. Evercore is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, competitive biddings, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

We retained Qatalyst Partners to act as financial advisor to the Board of Directors in connection with a potential transaction such as the Merger and to evaluate whether the consideration to be received by the holders of our company common stock, other than HP or any affiliates of HP, pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

We selected Qatalyst Partners to act as our financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners’ qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business and affairs of Aruba and the industry in which it operates. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written consent to the reproduction of the Qatalyst Partners’ opinion in this proxy statement. At the meeting of the Board of Directors on March 1, 2015, Qatalyst Partners rendered its oral opinion, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the considerations, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the $24.67 per share cash consideration to be received by Aruba’s stockholders, other than HP or any affiliates of HP, pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The full text of Qatalyst Partners’ written opinion to the Board of Directors, dated March 1, 2015, is attached hereto as Annex B and is incorporated by reference herein. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. You should read the opinion carefully in its entirety. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion was provided to the Board of Directors and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness from a financial point of view, of the $24.67 per share cash consideration to be received by Aruba’s stockholders, other than HP or any affiliates of HP, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and it does not address any other aspect of the Merger. It does not constitute a recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company common stock will trade at any time. The summary of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft, dated February 28, 2015, of the Merger Agreement, certain related documents, and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of Aruba. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed certain forward-looking information prepared by the management of Aruba, including financial projections and operating data of Aruba, which we refer to as the “Management Projections”, described below in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger — Management Projections”. Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed with senior executives of Aruba the past and current operations, financial condition, and prospects of Aruba. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company common stock and compared the financial performance of Aruba and the prices and trading activity of Company common stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Qatalyst Partners deemed appropriate.

In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by Aruba. With respect to the Management Projections, Qatalyst Partners was advised by the management of Aruba, and Qatalyst Partners assumed, that the Management Projections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Aruba of the future financial performance of Aruba and other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the draft, dated February 28, 2015, of the Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. Qatalyst Partners also assumed that the final executed Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft, dated February 28, 2015, of the Merger Agreement that Qatalyst Partners reviewed. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on Aruba or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Aruba, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of Aruba as to the existing and future technology and products of Aruba and the risks associated with such technology and products. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion has been approved by Qatalyst Partners’ opinion committee in accordance with its customary practice.

Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the opinion may affect Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Aruba to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Aruba. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the $24.67 per share cash consideration to be received

by Aruba’s stockholders, other than HP or any affiliates of HP, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and Qatalyst Partners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of Aruba’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.

The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion dated March 1, 2015. The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners’ opinion. For the purposes of certain of its analyses, Qatalyst Partners utilized both the consensus of third-party research analysts’ projections, which we refer to as the “Analyst Projections”, and the Management Projections. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners’ financial analyses.

**Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis**

Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a potential, present value of share values for Aruba’s common stock as of January 31, 2015 by:

•adding:

(a)the implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows of Aruba, based on the Management Projections, for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2015, ending July 31, 2015, through fiscal year 2019, ending July 31, 2019 (which implied present value was calculated by using a range of discount rates of 10.5% to 14.0%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital; and

(b)the implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of Aruba, calculated by multiplying the estimated net operating profit after taxes (“NOPAT”) (assuming a cash tax rate of 25%) in fiscal year 2020, based on the Management Projections, by a range of multiples of fully-diluted enterprise value to next-twelve-months NOPAT of 11.0x to 16.0x, and discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates used in item (a)above;

•applying a dilution factor of 28% provided by Aruba’s management to reflect the dilution to current stockholders, assuming no buybacks, over the projection period due to the effect of future equity compensation grants projected by Aruba’s management; and

•dividing the resulting amount by the number of fully-diluted shares (assuming treasury stock method) of Aruba’s common stock outstanding, adjusted for restricted stock units and market stock units and stock options outstanding, as provided by Aruba’s management as of February 27, 2015.

Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of values for Company common stock of approximately $20.85 to $30.02 per share.

**Illustrative Selected Companies Analysis**

Qatalyst Partners compared selected financial information and public market multiples for Aruba with publicly available information and public market multiples for companies selected by Qatalyst Partners. The companies used in this comparison included companies listed below and were selected because they are publicly traded companies in Aruba’s industry.

Based upon research analyst consensus estimates for calendar year 2015, and using the closing prices as of February 27, 2015 for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated, among other things, the implied price to earnings per share multiples for calendar year 2015, which we refer to as the “CY2015E P/E Multiples”, for each group of the selected companies. The median CY2015E P/E Multiples among the selected WLAN Vendor companies analyzed was 20.5x, among the selected Pure Play Networking companies analyzed was 20.6x, and among the selected Traditional Networking companies analyzed was 13.4x. The CY2015E P/E Multiple for Aruba was 14.9x based on the Analyst Projections using Aruba’s closing share price on February 24, 2015.

Based on an analysis of the CY2015E P/E Multiples for the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of 14.0x to 20.0x and applied this range to Aruba’s estimated calendar year 2015 per share earnings based on each of the Management Projections and the Analyst Projections. This analysis implied a range of values for Company common stock of approximately $18.52 to $26.46 per share based on the Management Projections and approximately $17.23 to $24.61 per share based on the Analyst Projections.

No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to Aruba. In evaluating the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the control of Aruba, such as the impact of competition on the business of Aruba and the industry in general, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of Aruba or the industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.

**Illustrative Selected Transactions Analysis**

Qatalyst Partners compared seven selected public company transactions announced since 2008 selected by Qatalyst Partners. These transactions are listed below:

For each of the transactions listed above, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, the implied fully-diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of the last-twelve-months revenue, as reflected in certain publicly available financial statements and press releases, which we refer to as the “LTM Revenue Multiple”. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the implied fully-diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of analyst estimates of the next-twelve-months revenue of the target company, when available, which we refer to as the “NTM Revenue Multiple”. The median LTM Revenue Multiple among the selected transactions analyzed was 2.5x, and the median NTM Revenue Multiple among the selected transactions analyzed was 2.4x.

Based on the analysis of the LTM Revenue Multiples and NTM Revenue Multiples for the transactions noted above, Qatalyst Partners applied an LTM Revenue Multiple range of 1.4x to 3.4x (the minimum and maximum multiples for such transactions) to Aruba’s LTM (ending January 31, 2015) revenue, and an NTM Revenue Multiple range of 2.0x to 3.2x (the minimum and maximum multiples for such transactions) to Aruba’s NTM (ending January 31, 2016) estimated revenue reflected in the Analyst Projections. Based on the calculations set forth above and Aruba’s fully-diluted shares (assuming the treasury stock method), including common stock, RSUs/MSUs and stock options outstanding as provided by management of Aruba as of February 27, 2015, this analysis implied a range of values for Aruba’s common stock of approximately $11.88 to $25.33 per share, with Aruba’s common stock value attributable to the median multiple of such transactions of $19.40 per share based on the LTM multiples, and approximately $17.54 to $26.86 per share, with a median of $20.80 per share, based on the NTM multiples.

For each of the transactions listed above, Qatalyst Partners also reviewed, among other things, the price per share paid for the target company as a multiple of the last-twelve-months earnings per share for the target company, as reflected in certain publicly available financial statements and press releases, which we refer to as the “LTM P/E Multiple”. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the price per share paid for the target company as a multiple of analyst estimates of the next-twelve-months earnings per share of the target company, which we refer to as the “NTM P/E Multiple”. The median LTM P/E Multiple among the selected transactions analyzed was 22.0x, and the median NTM P/E Multiple among the selected transactions analyzed was 24.3x.

Based on the analysis of the LTM P/E Multiples and the NTM P/E Multiples for the transactions noted above, Qatalyst Partners applied an LTM P/E Multiple range of 18.4x to 25.3x (the minimum and maximum multiples for such transactions) to Aruba’s LTM (ending January 31, 2015) earnings per share, and an NTM P/E Multiple range of 18.9x to 28.4x (the minimum and maximum multiples for such transactions) to Aruba’s NTM (ending January 31, 2016) earnings per share reflected in the Analyst Projections. Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of values for Aruba’s common stock of approximately $18.34 to $25.26 per share, with a median of $21.96 per share, based on the LTM multiples, and approximately $23.21 to $34.91 per share, with a median of $29.86 per share, based on the NTM multiples.

No company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to Aruba or the Merger. In evaluating the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Aruba, such as the impact of competition on the business of Aruba or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the financial condition of Aruba or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to which they are being compared. Because of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the Merger, Qatalyst Partners cautioned against placing undue reliance on this information.

**Miscellaneous**

In connection with the review of the Merger by the Board of Directors, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description. In

##### [Index to Financial Statements](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm#INDEX)

arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Qatalyst Partners’ view of the actual value of Aruba. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Aruba. Any estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.

Qatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the $24.67 per share cash consideration to be received by Aruba’s stockholders, other than HP or any affiliates of HP, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and in connection with the delivery of its opinion to the Board of Directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the price at which Company common stock might actually trade.

Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors considered by the Board of Directors in deciding to approve the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board of Directors with respect to the $24.67 per share cash consideration to be received by Aruba’s stockholders pursuant to the Merger or of whether the Board of Directors would have been willing to agree to different consideration. The $24.67 per share cash consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Aruba and HP and was approved by the Board of Directors. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to Aruba during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to Aruba or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.

Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of corporations and individuals, domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of Aruba, HP or certain of their respective affiliates. During the two year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and Aruba or HP pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates; however, Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to Aruba or HP or any of their respective affiliates for which it would expect to receive compensation.

Under the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided Aruba with financial advisory services in connection with the proposed Merger for which it will be paid approximately $30 million, $100,000 of which was payable upon the execution of its engagement letter, $5 million of which was payable upon delivery of its opinion, and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, consummation of the Merger. Aruba has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for its expenses incurred in performing its services. Aruba has also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any person controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities law, and expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners’ engagement.

**[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm)Management Projections**

Aruba does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose projections as to its future financial performance. However, in connection with the comprehensive strategic and financial review process as described in this proxy statement, management prepared two sets of financial projections. In October 2014, management prepared projections for fiscal years 2015-2017, which were provided to representatives of Qatalyst Partners and the representatives of HP, which we refer to as the “October Projections”. In February 2015, management updated and supplemented the October Projections to create (i)projections for the remainder of fiscal year 2015 and fiscal years 2016-2017, which we refer to as the “2015-2017 Projections”, and (ii)based on its extrapolation of trends in the 2015-2017 Projections, projections for fiscal years 2018-2020, which we refer to as the “2018-2020 Projections”, which, together with the projections described in clause (i), we refer to as the “February Projections”. We refer collectively to the February Projections and the October Projections as the “Management Projections”. The Management Projections were the only financial forecasts with respect to Aruba provided by Aruba for use by its financial advisors in performing their financial analyses during the strategic and financial review process.

The Management Projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy statement only because the October Projections were provided to the representatives of Qatalyst Partners and representatives of HP and the 2015-2017 Projections were provided to the Board of Directors and certain portions thereof were also made available to HP and its representatives in the strategic and financial review process in connection with its due diligence review of Aruba. The February Projections were made available to Qatalyst Partners and Evercore for use in connection with their respective provision of financial advisory services as described in this proxy statement. The Management Projections were not prepared with a view to compliance with (1)GAAP, (2)the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements; or (3)the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. PricewaterhouseCoopers, our independent registered public accountant, has not examined, reviewed, compiled or otherwise applied procedures to the Management Projections and, accordingly, assumes no responsibility for, and expresses no opinion on, them. The Management Projections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Aruba management.

Although a summary of the Management Projections is presented with numerical specificity, they reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by Aruba management that they believed were reasonable at the time the Management Projections were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to Aruba management at the time. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Management Projections not to be achieved include general economic conditions, Aruba’s ability to achieve forecasted sales, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures and changes in tax laws. In addition, the Management Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the Merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Management Projections. The Management Projections cover multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. The inclusion of the Management Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Board of Directors, Aruba, Qatalyst Partners, Evercore, HP or any of their respective affiliates or representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Management Projections to be predictive of actual future results. The summary of the Management Projections is not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any stockholder to vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting. We do not intend to update or otherwise revise the Management Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Management Projections are shown to be in error or no longer appropriate. **In light of the**

**foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Projections, stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the projections included in this proxy statement**.

The Management Projections and the accompanying tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP gross profit, which Aruba believes are helpful in understanding its past financial performance and future results. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with Aruba’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliation to GAAP measures presented herein. Aruba’s management regularly uses Aruba’s supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and manage the business and forecast future periods.

The Management Projections are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause Aruba’s future results to materially vary, see the information under the section captioned “_Forward-Looking Statements_.”

Set forth below is a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP gross profit to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, based on financial information available to, or projected by, Aruba (totals may not add due to rounding):

As set forth above, the reconciliation of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP gross profit from the October 2014 Projections were substantially similar to those for the February 2015 Projections.

As noted above, the plans and projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions made with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to our business, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.

**[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm)Interests of Aruba’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger**

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally, as more fully described

below. In (i)evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii)approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii)recommending that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby be adopted by stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters.

**_Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers_**

HP and Merger Sub have agreed that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current or former directors and officers of Aruba and each subsidiary of Aruba as provided in Aruba’s charter or bylaws (and comparable governing documents of the subsidiaries of Aruba that have been delivered and made available to HP prior to the date of the Merger Agreement) as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time will be assumed and performed by the Surviving Corporation and will continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of such acts or omissions, except as otherwise required by applicable law.

For a period of six years after the Effective Time, HP will cause to be maintained in effect Aruba’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering each person currently covered by Aruba’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy (a correct and complete copy of which was made available to HP before the execution of the Merger Agreement) for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, that HP may (i)substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than Aruba’s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement (ii)request that Aruba obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time); and provided, further, that in no event shall HP or Aruba be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under these provisions in excess of 150% of the amount of the annual premiums paid by Aruba for fiscal year 2014 for such purpose (which fiscal year 2014 premiums were represented and warranted by Aruba to be as set forth in Aruba’s disclosure letter), it being understood that HP shall nevertheless be obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained for such 150% amount. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Merger Agreement, Aruba may purchase a six-year “tail” prepaid policy on Aruba’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, provided, that the aggregate cost for such “tail” policy shall not exceed 250% of the amount of the annual premiums paid by Aruba for fiscal year 2014 for such purpose. In the event that Aruba elects to purchase such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and HP will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of the Surviving Corporation (and HP) under the first sentence of this paragraph for so long as such “tail” policy shall be maintained in full force and effect (subject to the proviso in the preceding sentence). For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement — Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance_”.

**_Treatment of Equity-Based Awards_**

_Treatment of Stock Options_

As of April 2, 2015, there were 4,022,288 outstanding stock options with an exercise price less than $24.67 per share, of which 2,802,566 were held by our directors and executive officers.

At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of our common stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a person providing services to us immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become an option with respect to HP common stock and HP will assume each unvested option to purchase shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and the terms of the applicable stock

option agreement, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i)HP and its compensation committee will be substituted for the Company and the compensation committee of the Company’s board administering such Company Stock Plans; (ii)each unvested option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for HP common stock (or cash, if permitted under the terms of the applicable unvested option or required under applicable law); (iii)the number of shares of HP common stock subject to the unvested option will be equal to the number of shares of our common stock subject to the option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share; and (iv)the per share exercise price for each such option will be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each such unvested option by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent. However, any unvested, unexercised and outstanding options to purchase Company common stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have a per share exercise price greater than $24.67 will not be assumed by HP and will automatically terminate as of the Effective Time.

At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of our common stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and each former holder of any such cancelled vested option will be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to any applicable withholdings or other taxes, or other amounts as required by law) equal to the product of (1)the total number of outstanding shares of common stock subject to such vested option as of the Effective Time and (2)the amount, if any, by which $24.67 exceeds the exercise price per share of common stock underlying such stock option. Each option with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than $24.67 per share will be cancelled without any cash payment.

_Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_

As of April 2, 2015, there were 8,451,890 outstanding Restricted Stock Units, of which 909,000 were market stock units at 150% of target, and of which Restricted Stock Units 742,926 were held by our directors and executive officers, of which 202,500 were market stock units at 150% of target.

At the Effective Time, each award of unvested Restricted Stock Units (including each market stock unit) granted under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a person providing services to us immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those Restricted Stock Units that will become vested as a result of the consummation of the Merger) will be converted into and become rights with respect to shares of common stock of HP and HP will assume the Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plans and/or restricted stock unit agreement, as applicable, except that from and after the Effective Time (i)HP and its compensation committee will be substituted for the Company and the compensation committee of Aruba’s Board of Directors administering such Company Stock Plans; (ii)the Restricted Stock Units assumed by HP will represent the right to receive shares of HP common stock (or cash, if permitted under the terms of the applicable Restricted Stock Units or as required by law) upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units promptly after vesting (except to the extent the terms of the applicable Restricted Stock Unit provide for deferred settlement, in which case settlement will be in accordance with the specified terms); and (iii)the number of shares of HP common stock subject to the Restricted Stock Units will equal the number of shares of our common stock subject to the applicable Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied_ _by_ the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and HP will convert any remaining fractional share into the right to receive cash based on the Parent Closing Price).

Pursuant to the individual market stock unit agreements, at the Effective Time, the (i)number of Earned MSUs will be determined by shortening the performance period to end upon the Effective Time and (ii)a participant will vest in the number of Earned MSUs equal to (A)(1) the number of fully completed calendar months that have elapsed from the commencement of the performance period set forth in the market stock unit agreements through the Effective Time, _divided by_ (2)the total number of months in the original performance period (notwithstanding the Merger), _multiplied by_ (B)the Earned MSUs, with the result rounded down to the nearest whole share. The Earned MSUs that vest at the Effective Time will receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Earned MSUs that do not vest under the individual market stock unit agreements at the Effective Time will be converted into Restricted Stock Units of HP at the Effective Time (with the adjustments

described in the paragraph above) and will vest in equal quarterly installments at the end of each three month period following the Effective Time, with the number of quarterly vesting dates equal to (i)(A) the total number of months in the original performance period set forth in the market stock unit agreement (notwithstanding the Merger) _less_ (B)the number of fully completed calendar months that have elapsed from the commencement of the performance period through the Effective Time, _divided by_ (ii)three (rounded down to the nearest whole number). However, 100% of the Earned MSUs that are unvested as of the last day of the original performance period will vest on the last day of the original performance period, unless vested earlier. The market stock units that do not become Earned MSUs will be forfeited at the Effective Time.

**_Treatment of Purchase Rights under the ESPP_**

Any current offering period as of the date of the Merger Agreement will be the final offering period under the ESPP. After the date of the Merger Agreement, no new participants will be permitted to join any current offering period in progress under the ESPP and no ESPP participant will be permitted to increase his or her contributions or the amount of withholding elections with respect to any current offering period. The ESPP will terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall shorten the duration of any then-current offering period under the ESPP and purchase shares of our common stock with all amounts withheld on behalf of the participants. All outstanding shares of common stock purchased under the ESPP and held by an individual as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled as of the Effective Time and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, and less any applicable withholding taxes. All amounts withheld that have not been used to purchase our common stock at or prior to the Effective Time will be returned to the participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the ESPP upon the termination of the ESPP.

**_Payments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control_**

_All Executive Officers_

The Company previously adopted the Severance and Change of Control Policy. Under the Severance and Change of Control Policy, in the event an executive officer’s service is terminated as a result of an “Involuntary Termination” without “Cause” during the period beginning 3 months prior to and ending 12 months after a “Change of Control” (each as defined in the Severance and Change of Control Policy), the following severance payments would be made, subject to the execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company and enumerated related persons and that release becoming effective and irrevocable:

•CEO — 150% of base salary and annual target bonus as in effect immediately prior to the termination date, plus 18 months COBRA reimbursement, plus 100% vesting of then-unvested shares subject to then-outstanding equity awards.

•Other executive officers — 100% of base salary and annual target bonus as in effect immediately prior to the termination date, plus 12 months COBRA reimbursement, plus 100% vesting of then-unvested shares subject to then-outstanding equity awards.

The Severance and Change of Control Policy provides that in the event any amount paid to an executive officer upon a Change in Control is deemed to be an “excess parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the executive officer will be entitled to either (i)the full amount of the payment, or (ii)a lesser amount if such reduction would result in the executive officer retaining a greater amount of such payments and benefits on an after-tax basis had no reduction been made. No tax gross-ups are provided for under the Severance and Change of Control Policy.

“Cause” for the purposes of the Severance and Change of Control Policy means (a)unauthorized use or disclosure of the Company’s confidential information or trade secrets, (b)a material failure to comply with the Company’s written policies or rules, (c)conviction of, or plea of “guilty” or “no contest” to, a felony under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, or (d)gross misconduct.

“Involuntary Termination” for purposes of the Severance and Change of Control Policy as it applies to executive officers means either (a)involuntary discharge by the Company for reasons other than Cause or (b)voluntary resignation following (i)a change in position with the Company that materially reduces the executive officer’s level of authority or responsibility, (ii)a material reduction in base salary, or (iii)receipt of notice that the principal workplace will be relocated more than 35 miles, to which the executive officer does not consent to such discharge, change in position, reduction, or relocation.

The executive officers who have entered into employment agreements with HP agreed to waive the benefits provided under the Severance and Change of Control Policy that are triggered by an involuntary termination during the period beginning 3 months prior to and ending 12 months after a Change in Control in exchange for the compensation opportunities offered by HP in the employment agreement. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “—HP Employment Agreements” below for additional detail.

Under the Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, any equity awards issued thereunder held by a non-employee director that are assumed or substituted in connection with a “change in control” will fully vest in the event that the service of the non-employee director terminates other than upon a voluntary resignation of the non-employee director (unless such resignation is at the request of the acquirer).

**_HP Employment Agreements_**

_Dominic Orr_

On March 2, 2015, Mr.Orr entered into an employment agreement with HP, which provides that upon and subject to the Closing, Mr.Orr will be employed as Senior Vice-President, HP Networking. The employment agreement provides that Mr.Orr’s initial annual base salary will be $600,000 and he will be eligible for a target bonus opportunity equal to 80% of his eligible earnings, with a maximum bonus opportunity equal to 200% of his eligible earnings for the current fiscal year under HP’s Pay-for-Results Annual Bonus Plan.

In addition, the employment agreement provides that Mr.Orr will be granted HP restricted stock units valued at $3,000,000, with each unit equal to one share of HP common stock subject to approval by HP’s board of directors under the Second Amended and Restated HP Company 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. The restrictions subject to the HP restricted stock units will lapse as to one-third of the HP restricted stock units on each anniversary of the grant date.

In the event Mr.Orr’s employment with HP is involuntarily terminated by HP other than for “cause” (as defined in Mr.Orr’s employment agreement) prior to the third anniversary of Mr.Orr’s start date, Mr.Orr will be eligible to receive the following severance benefits, subject to his execution and non-revocation of a release agreement:

•a cash payment equal to Mr.Orr’s annual base salary at the time of separation — 50% to be paid in a lump sum within two and a half months following Mr.Orr’s separation and the remaining 50% to be paid in a lump sum 12 months following the separation date, contingent upon Mr.Orr’s continued compliance with any post-employment obligations;

•a lump sum payment, paid within two and a half months following Mr.Orr’s separation, which approximately equals the cost of COBRA premiums for Mr.Orr and any covered dependents for six months; and

•restrictions on any HP restricted stock or restricted stock units (if any) will be released as to a prorated number of shares or units, provided Mr.Orr has worked for at least 25% of the entire vesting period. Pro-rata vesting, will be applied separately to each separately-granted award in its entirety and will be based on the number of completed calendar months of active service during the total vesting period for time-based awards or during the relevant performance period for performance-based awards.

Mr.Orr waives all exercisability and vesting acceleration provisions currently in effect for his equity (including options, stock units and restricted stock) granted in Aruba such that no accelerated exercisability or vesting will occur in connection with the Merger or in the event Mr.Orr’s employment or service should terminate following the closing date of the Merger (including pursuant to the Severance and Change of Control Policy), except that upon consummation of the Merger, 25% of the value of his Aruba equity that is unvested immediately prior to the closing of the Merger will become immediately vested upon such closing (rounded to the nearest whole unit) and all restrictions upon such restricted stock units shall immediately lapse and the underlying shares shall be settled in accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement. Mr.Orr also waives any additional Aruba severance benefits (including pursuant to the Severance and Change of Control Policy) and any severance benefits to which he may become entitled shall be determined in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement with HP.

_Keerti Melkote_

On March 2, 2015, Mr.Melkote entered into an employment agreement with HP, which provides that contingent upon the Closing, Mr.Melkote will be employed as Vice-President and Chief Technologist, HP Networking and Mr.Melkote’s employment is targeted to transfer to HP after the completion of HP’s separation into two legal entities, which is currently projected to occur in November 2015.

The employment agreement provides that Mr.Melkote’s initial annual base salary will be $375,000 and he will be eligible for a target bonus opportunity equal to 50% of his eligible earnings, with a maximum bonus opportunity equal to 150% of his eligible earnings for the current fiscal year under HP’s Pay-for-Results Annual Bonus Plan.

In addition, the employment agreement provides that Mr.Melkote will be granted HP restricted stock units valued at $3,000,000, with each unit equal to one share of HP common stock subject to approval by HP’s board of directors under the Second Amended and Restated HP Company 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. The restrictions subject to the HP restricted stock units will lapse as to one-third of the HP restricted stock units on each anniversary of the grant date.

In the event Mr.Melkote’s employment with HP is involuntarily terminated by HP other than for “cause” (as defined in Mr.Melkote’s employment agreement) prior to the third anniversary of Mr.Melkote’s start date, Mr.Melkote will be eligible to receive the following severance benefits, subject to his execution and non-revocation of a release agreement:

•a lump sum payment, paid within two and a half months following Mr.Melkote’s separation, which approximately equals the cost of COBRA premiums for Mr.Melkote and any covered dependents for three months.

Mr.Melkote waives all exercisability and vesting acceleration provisions currently in effect for his equity (including options, stock units and restricted stock) granted in Aruba such that no accelerated exercisability or vesting will occur in connection with the Merger or in the event Mr.Melkote’s employment or service should terminate following the closing date of the Merger (including pursuant to the Severance and Change of Control Policy) except that upon consummation of the Merger, 25% of the value of his Aruba equity that is unvested immediately prior to the closing of the Merger will become immediately vested upon such closing (rounded to the nearest whole unit) and all restrictions upon such restricted stock units shall immediately lapse and the underlying shares shall be settled in accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement. Mr.Melkote also waives any additional Aruba severance benefits (including pursuant to the Severance and Change of Control Policy) and any severance benefits to which he may become entitled shall be determined in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement with HP.

**_Golden Parachute Compensation_**

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger that will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Please see the previous portions of this section for further information regarding this compensation.

The amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable assuming, solely for purposes of this table, that the Merger is consummated on May 15, 2015, and that the employment of each of the named executive officers was subject to an involuntary termination on the date described in the footnotes below, as applicable. Aruba’s executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation, tax reimbursement or other benefits in connection with the Merger.

Some of the amounts set forth in the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the Merger. In addition to the assumptions regarding the consummation date of the Merger and the termination of employment, these estimates are based on certain other assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table below. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger may differ from the amounts set forth below. The values in the table below payable by HP are not subject to the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may become payable to Aruba’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

(1)This amount represents the “double-trigger” cash severance payments to which each named executive officer may become entitled under the Severance and Change of Control Policy, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—_Payments upon Termination following Change-in-Control_”. For each named executive officer who has entered into an HP employment agreement, the amount in this column assumes that such named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination within the three month period prior to the consummation of the Merger. For each other named executive officer, the amount in this column assumes that such named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination on the consummation of the Merger or within twelve months thereafter. The amount represents 150% of the annual base salary and target annual bonus opportunity for Mr.Orr, effective January 1, 2015, and 100% of the annual base salary and target annual bonus opportunity for the other named executive officers, effective January 1, 2015.

(2)This amount represents the “double-trigger” cash severance payments to which each named executive officer who has entered into an HP employment agreement may become entitled following the consummation of the Merger, as described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “_—Payments upon Termination following Change-in-Control_”. For each such named executive officer, the amount in this column assumes that such named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination following the consummation of the Merger. The amount represents 100% of the annual base salary for Mr.Orr, effective as of the date he commences employment with HP in connection with consummation of the Merger, and 100% of the annual base salary and target annual bonus opportunity for Mr.Melkote, each effective as of the date he commences employment with HP in connection with consummation of the Merger. As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—_Payment upon Termination following Change-in-Control_”, each such named executive officer agreed to waive his rights to the severance benefits under the Severance and Change of Control Policy contingent upon the consummation of the Merger when his HP employment agreement becomes effective.

(3)This amount represents the product of (a)$24.67 per share _multiplied by_ (b)the number of shares subject to each named executive officer’s outstanding (i)in-the-money options (i.e., options to purchase shares of common stock with an exercise price of less than $24.67 per share) and (ii)Restricted Stock Units (including market stock units) (and, in the case of the in-the-money options, reduced by their aggregate exercise price). These are the “double-trigger” vesting acceleration benefits to which each named executive officer is entitled under the Severance and Change of Control Policy, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_—Payments upon Termination following Change-in-Control_” section above. For purposes of determining the number of Restricted Stock Units that are market stock units that will vest as of the consummation of the Merger, we have assumed that the stock price goals set forth in the market stock units agreements will have been met at 150% of target as of the date of the consummation of the Merger. For each named executive officer who has entered into an HP employment agreement prior to the date hereof, the amount in this column assumes that

such named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination within the three month period prior to the consummation of the Merger, the HP employment agreement does not become effective, and such named executive officer becomes entitled to full vesting acceleration of his Aruba options and Restricted Stock Units (including market stock units) under the Severance and Change of Control Policy. For each other named executive officer, the amount in this column assumes that such named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination on the consummation of the Merger and is entitled to full vesting acceleration of his Aruba options and Restricted Stock Units (including market stock units) under the Severance and Change of Control Policy. The portion of the amounts in this column relating to the “single-trigger” equity benefits for each named executive officer is as follows: $51,513,125 (Mr. Orr) of which all $51,513,125 relates to the cancellation and cashout of previously vested stock options, $513,950 (Mr. Galvin), $564,977 (Mr. Melkote) of which $153,810 relates to the cancellation and cashout of vested stock options, and $411,175 (Mr. DiLullo). The “single-trigger” equity benefits represent the sum of the value of the in-the-money options that vested prior to the consummation of the Merger and the portion of the Restricted Stock Units that are market stock units that vest on the consummation of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the market stock unit agreements (assuming 150% achievement of the performance metrics). These amounts do not take into account any “single-trigger” equity acceleration benefits under any HP employment agreement, which benefits are addressed in footnote (4) below.

(4)This amount represents the equity benefits to which each named executive officer who has entered into an HP employment agreement may become entitled on the consummation of the Merger, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_—Payments upon Termination following Change-in-Control_”. The following amounts represent the full value of the HP equity awards ($3,000,000 for each of Messrs. Orr and Melkote) and the value of 25% of each of the executive officer’s Company equity awards that will fully vest on the consummation of the Merger, in each case as provided under the terms of such named executive officer’s HP employment agreement. The HP equity award grants are subject to multi-year vesting that requires continued service by the executive officer. As such, the executive officers will not realize any value from these awards unless and until they vest pursuant to their terms. The portion of the amount of this column relating to Company equity awards represents the product of (a)$24.67 per share _multiplied by_ (b)25% of the shares subject to each in-the-money option (i.e., options to purchase shares of common stock with an exercise price of less than $24.67 per share), and 25% of the restricted stock units (including market stock units after taking into account the vesting acceleration provided under the market stock unit agreement) that are vesting on the consummation of the Merger (and, in the case of the in-the-money options, reduced by their aggregate exercise price), as provided in such named executive officer’s HP offer letter. As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_—Payment upon Termination following Change-in-Control,_” each such named executive officer agreed to waive his rights to the equity acceleration benefits under the Severance and Change of Control Policy upon the effectiveness of his HP employment agreement.

(5)This amount equals the estimated value of the “double-trigger” COBRA benefits to which each named executive officer may become entitled under the Severance and Change of Control Policy, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_—Payments upon Termination following Change-in-Control_”. For each named executive officer who has entered into an HP employment agreement, the amount in this column assumes that such named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination within the three month period prior to the consummation of the Merger. For each other named executive officer, the amount in this column assumes that such named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination on the consummation of the Merger or within twelve months thereafter. The amount represents 18 months of COBRA benefits for Mr.Orr and 12 months of COBRA benefits for the other named executive officers.

(6)This amount represents the “double-trigger” lump sum payment for COBRA benefits to which each named executive officer who has entered into an HP employment agreement may become entitled following the consummation of the Merger, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_—Payments upon Termination following Change-in-Control_”. For each such named executive officer, the amount in this column assumes that such named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination following the consummation of the Merger. The amount represents six months of COBRA benefits for Mr.Orr and three months of COBRA benefits for Mr.Melkote in each case, calculated based on COBRA rates in effect as of the date of this filing. As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_—Payment upon Termination following Change-in-Control,_” each such named executive officer agreed to waive his rights to the severance benefits under the Severance and Change of Control Policy upon the effectiveness of his HP employment agreement.

(7)This amount represents the sum of the amounts in the “Aruba Cash,” “Aruba Equity,” and “Aruba Perquisites/Benefits” columns. For each named executive officer who has entered into an HP employment agreement, the amount in this column assumes that such named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination within the three month period prior to the consummation of the Merger. For each other named executive officer, the amount in this column assumes that such named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination on the consummation of the Merger or within twelve months thereafter.

(8)This amount represents the sum of the amounts in the “HP Cash,” “HP Equity,” and “HP Perquisites/Benefits” columns for each named executive officer who has entered into an HP employment agreement and, as applicable, assumes that such named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination following the consummation of the Merger.

(9)Mr.Kirby resigned from his position as Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales in November 2013 and thus is not entitled to any “golden parachute” compensation in connection with the Merger.

**_Equity Interests of Aruba’s’ Executive Officers and Non-Employee Directors_**

The following table sets forth the number of shares of common stock and the number of shares of common stock underlying Company equity awards that are in-the-money and are currently held by each of Aruba’s executive officers and non-employee directors, in each case that either are currently vested or that will vest in connection with the Merger, assuming that the Effective Time occurs on May 15, 2015. The table also sets forth the values of these shares and equity awards based on the $24.67 per share Merger Consideration (minus the applicable exercise price for the in-the-money options). No new shares of common stock or equity awards were granted to any executive officer or non-employee director in contemplation of the Merger. The table does not reflect any share purchases under the ESPP that may be made between the date of this filing and May 15, 2015. For purposes of this table, any shares subject to Company equity awards held by Aruba’s executive and

non-employee directors that vest between the date hereof and May 15, 2015 are considered outstanding shares of common stock held by the applicable executive or non-employee director. In addition, for purposes of determining the shares that are vested and outstanding, the single-trigger vesting acceleration benefits under the HP employment agreements are deemed to apply such that Messrs. Orr and Melkote are considered vested in an additional 25% of shares subject to their outstanding equity awards that otherwise would have been unvested by their terms. For purposes of determining the number of Restricted Stock Units that are market stock units that will vest as of the consummation of the Merger, the stock price goals set forth in the market stock units agreements are assumed to have been met at 150% of target as of the date of the consummation of the Merger. We also have assumed that service of each non-employee director will terminate in connection with the Merger giving rise to full vesting acceleration of such non-employee director’s equity awards under the Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended.

The closing of the Merger will take place no later than the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver in accordance with the Merger Agreement of all of the conditions to closing of the Merger (as described in the section of this proxy captioned “_The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Merger_”), other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions.

If the Merger is completed, stockholders who have complied exactly with the procedures set forth in Section 262, including stockholders who (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) continuously hold their shares of our common stock through the Effective Time, and (iii) properly demand appraisal of their shares of common stock in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 are entitled to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under Section 262 and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in such holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.

Under Section 262, holders of shares of common stock who: (i)do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; (ii)continuously hold their shares of common stock through the Effective Time; and (iii)otherwise follow exactly the procedures set forth in Section 262, will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period.

Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to exercise appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Aruba’s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so should review Annex C carefully.

**Failure to comply exactly with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.**

A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of common stock, Aruba believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, such stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must, among other requirements, do **ALL** of the following:

•the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby;

•the stockholder must deliver to Aruba a written demand for appraisal that complies with Section 262 before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting; and

•the stockholder must continuously hold the shares of common stock through the Effective Time.

The stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must also file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares of common stock within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.

Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, abstain or not vote its shares.

**_Filing Written Demand_**

Any holder of shares of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Aruba, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will be submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions

contemplated thereby. A holder of shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made, and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby or abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the Special Meeting will result in a loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.

Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in such holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Aruba of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares of common stock in connection with the Merger. If the shares of common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.

STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be delivered to:

Aruba Networks, Inc.

Attn: Corporate Secretary

1344 Crossman Avenue

Sunnyvale, California 94089

Any holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to Aruba a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation.

No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however that such dismissal will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time.

**_Notice by the Surviving Corporation_**

If the Merger is completed, within ten days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof, and include a copy in such notice of Section 262.

**_Filing a Petition for Appraisal_**

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed by Section 262. The failure of a holder of shares of common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 will nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby with respect to which Aruba has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within ten days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.

If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to exercise appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require stockholders demanding appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.

**_Determination of Fair Value_**

After determining the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the “fair value” of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. In _Weinberger v. UOP, Inc._, the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In _Cede& Co.v. Technicolor, Inc._, the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In _Weinberger_, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. **Although Aruba believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration**. Neither Aruba nor HP anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Aruba and HP reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.

If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, such stockholder’s shares of common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.

From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of common stock, if any, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any stockholder who commenced the proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval of the court.

**Failure to comply exactly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.**

**[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm)Accounting Treatment**

The Merger will be accounted for as a “purchase transaction” for financial accounting purposes.

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of our common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the “Code”, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the “IRS”, and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes).

This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:

•tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as banks and other financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S-corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and partners or investors therein); insurance companies; mutual funds; brokers or dealers in stocks and securities; traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

•tax consequences to holders holding the shares of common stock as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reduction transaction;

•tax consequences to holders that received their shares of common stock on exercise of notes, warrants or options or otherwise in a compensatory transaction;

•tax consequences to holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in HP or the Surviving Corporation following the Merger;

•tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

•tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;

•tax consequences to holders who hold their shares as “qualified small business stock” within the meaning of Section 1202 of the Code or Section 1244 Stock for purposes of the Code;

•the U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any; or

•any state, local or foreign tax consequences.

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger.

No ruling from the IRS and no opinion of counsel has been or will be obtained regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger described below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.

**THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION.**

**_U.S. Holders_**

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

•an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

•a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

•an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•a trust (1)that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2)that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized generally must be calculated separately for each block of shares (i.e. shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) surrendered pursuant to the Merger. Additionally, certain non-corporate U.S. Holders may also be subject to a 3.8% Federal surtax on “net investment income” as defined in Section 1411 of the Code, which may include capital gain on shares surrendered in the Merger.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Special rules not discussed below may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders subject to special tax treatment such as “controlled foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies.” Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax consequences that may be relevant to them in light of their particular circumstances. Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

•the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);

•such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) and may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses; or

•Aruba is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the Code, which we refer to as “USRPHC”, at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of common stock, which we refer to as the “Relevant Period”, and, if shares of common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the branch profits tax will not apply. We believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the Merger.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Information reporting and backup withholding (at a rate of 28%) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (i)a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on a properly completed IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (ii)a Non-U.S. Holder that (A)provides a certification of such holder’s foreign status on a properly completed appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or (B)otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm)Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger**

HP and Aruba have generally agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or approvals from governmental entities to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals (i)include that the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which we refer to as the “HSR Act”, has expired or been terminated; and (ii)may include the approval or clearance of the Merger pursuant to antitrust laws of Austria, Germany, Indonesia, and Ukraine, which we refer to collectively as the “foreign jurisdictions”, as required.

**_HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters_**

Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be completed until HP and Aruba file a notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission, which we refer to as the “FTC”, and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which we refer to as the “DOJ”, under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms (typically a 30 day period) or the early termination of that waiting period. HP and Aruba made the necessary filings with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ on March 12, 2015.

At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary under the applicable statutes, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

**_Foreign Competition Laws_**

Under the competition laws of the foreign jurisdictions certain competition law filings may be necessary. HP and Aruba made filings pursuant to applicable laws in Austria, Germany and Ukraine on March 31, 2015.

_Austria_

Under the Austrian Cartel Act, which we refer to as the “ACA”, and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be implemented until HP and Aruba file a notification and report form with the Federal Competition Authority, which we refer to as the “FCA”, and the FCA and the Federal Cartel Prosecutor, which we refer to as the “FCP”, have granted formal clearance. Formal clearance is granted to a transaction notifiable under the ACA in Phase I when neither the FCA nor FCP requests the initiation of Phase II proceedings (typically a four weeks waiting period), or when the FCA and FCP waive their rights to make such a request (minimum waiting period of two weeks). HP and Aruba filed a notification with the FCA on March 31, 2015.

At any time during the merger review process HP and Aruba may offer undertakings to remedy potential competition issues and secure formal approval. Such undertakings could include divestiture of assets of the parties or other non-structural remedies. Third parties whose legal or economic interests are affected by the transaction may intervene in merger proceedings by submitting written comments to the FCA and FCP.

_Germany_

Under the Act against Restraints of Competition and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be implemented until HP and Aruba file a notification and report form with the Federal Cartel Office, which we refer to as the “FCO”, and either the FCO has cleared the transaction or the relevant waiting periods of one month (Phase I) or four months (Phases I and II together) after submission of a complete notification have expired without the FCO having prohibited the transaction. HP and Aruba filed a notification with the FCO on March 31, 2015.

At any time during Phase II of the merger review process, HP and Aruba may offer undertakings to remedy potential competition issues and secure clearance from the FCO. Such undertakings could include divestiture of

assets of the parties or other non-structural remedies. Third parties whose interests are materially affected by the transaction may intervene in merger proceedings by submitting written comments to the FCO but cannot bring a private action against the Merger.

_Indonesia_

Under the Law of Prohibition of Monopoly and Unfair Business Competition Practices and the Government Regulation on Mergers, Consolidations and Acquisitions of Shares that May Result in Monopoly and Unfair Business Competition Practices and the rules promulgated thereunder, HP must file the post-merger notification with the Commission for Supervision of Business Competition, which we refer to as the “KPPU”, within 30 working days of the date on which the Merger becomes formally effective. There is no suspension of the completion of the transaction prior to the decision or opinion of the KPPU.

The transaction cannot be prohibited by the KPPU. However, if the KPPU were to find that the Merger is objectionable, it could open a formal investigation which could result in ordering the dissolution of the Merger or the imposition of sanctions. In such a case, the merged entity is given the opportunity to offer remedies.

_Ukraine_

Under the Protection of Economic Competition Act, which we refer to as the “Competition Act”, and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be implemented until HP and Aruba file a notification and report form with the Anti-Monopoly Committee of Ukraine, which we refer to as the “AMC”, and the AMC has approved the transaction or the waiting period of 45 working days has elapsed without the AMC adopting a decision regarding the transaction. The AMC’s approval has a validity of one year and the parties have to implement the transaction within this period. HP and Aruba filed a notification with the AMC on March 31, 2015.

At any time during the merger review process, HP and Aruba may offer undertakings to remedy potential competition issues and secure the approval from the AMC. Such undertakings could include divestiture of assets of the parties or other non-structural remedies. Third parties whose interests are materially affected by the transaction may intervene in merger proceedings and may seek injunctions from courts.

**_Other Regulatory Approvals_**

One or more governmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary approvals and consents. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial period of time between the approval by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.

Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.

**[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm)Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement**

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. **The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement. Capitalized terms in this section but not defined in this proxy statement have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement**.

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described in this section and included in the Merger Agreement (1)were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (2)were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (3)may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by HP, Aruba and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and, in some cases, were qualified by matters disclosed to HP and Merger Sub by Aruba in the disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement, rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Aruba, HP or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed after the date of the Merger Agreement and do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement and, accordingly, you should not rely on such representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts at the time they were made or as of the date of this proxy statement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Aruba, HP and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the disclosure letter delivered by Aruba in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding Aruba, HP, Merger Sub or their respective businesses or affiliates. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Aruba and our business.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of HP created solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, will merge with and into Aruba. The separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and Aruba will continue as the surviving corporation and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of HP.

From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Aruba and Merger Sub, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of Aruba and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be the initial officers of the surviving corporation. The directors and officers will serve in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will be amended and restated in their entirety in the form agreed by Aruba, HP and Merger Sub until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and as provided by law.

Unless otherwise mutually agreed by HP and Aruba, the closing of the Merger will occur at 10:00 a.m. Pacific time on the second business day after the conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement and described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Merger_” have been satisfied or waived (other than the conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver of those conditions).

The Merger will become effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as is agreed upon in writing by HP and Aruba and specified in the certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL. As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the Merger in the second or third quarter of calendar year 2015; however, consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the Merger more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Merger_” and we cannot specify when, or assure you that, Aruba and HP will satisfy or waive all conditions to the Merger. There may be a substantial amount of time between the date of the Special Meeting and the consummation of the Merger and it is possible that factors outside the control of Aruba or HP could delay the consummation of the Merger, or prevent the Merger from being consummated; however, we expect to consummate the Merger promptly following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions more fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Merger_”.

_Effect of the Merger on Aruba’s Capital Stock_

At the Effective Time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any shares resulting from the settlement of Restricted Stock Units which become vested as a result of the consummation of the Merger, but excluding excluded shares and dissenting shares, each as defined below) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $24.67 in cash, without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax. As of the Effective Time, all shares of our common stock will be cancelled and will thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock held in the treasury of Aruba or owned, directly or indirectly, by HP or Merger Sub, which we refer to as “excluded shares”, will be automatically canceled without payment of any consideration. In addition, each share of common stock held by stockholders who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL, which we refer to as “dissenting shares”, will not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, unless and until such stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such stockholder’s right to appraisal under the DGCL, at which time each such share of common stock will be converted into and exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the effective time and the time that such right to appraisal is irrevocably lost, the Merger Consideration. Dissenting shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger — Appraisal Rights_”.

_Treatment of Aruba Equity-Based Awards_

**_Outstanding Equity Awards_**

The Merger Agreement provides that the Company’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the following treatment at the Effective Time:

Unvested Options

At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of our common stock, granted under any Company Stock Plan that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a person providing services to us immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become an option with respect to HP common stock and HP will assume each unvested option to purchase shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and the terms of the applicable stock option agreement, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i)HP and its compensation committee will be substituted for the Company and the compensation committee of Aruba’s Board of Directors administering such Company Stock Plans; (ii)each unvested option assumed by HP may be exercised solely for HP common stock (or cash, if permitted under the terms of the applicable unvested option or required under applicable law); (iii)the number of shares of HP common stock subject to the unvested option will be equal to the number of shares of our common stock subject to the option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (as described below), rounded down to the nearest whole share; and (iv)the per share exercise price for each such option will be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each such unvested option by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent. However, any unvested, unexercised and outstanding options to purchase Company common stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have a per share exercise price greater than $24.67 will not be assumed by HP and will automatically terminate as of the Effective Time.

Vested Options

At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of our common stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and each former holder of any such cancelled vested option will be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to any applicable withholdings or other taxes, or other amounts as required by law) equal to the product of (1)the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock subject to such vested option as of the Effective Time and (2)the amount, if any, by which $24.67 exceeds the exercise price per share of common stock underlying such stock option. Each option with an exercise price per share equal to or greater than $24.67 per share will be cancelled without any cash payment.

Restricted Stock Units

At the Effective Time, each award of unvested Restricted Stock Units (including market stock units) granted under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a person providing services to us immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those Restricted Stock Units that will become vested as a result of the consummation of the Merger) will be converted into and become rights with respect to shares of HP common stock and HP will assume the Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the terms of Aruba’s Board of Directors and/or restricted stock unit agreement, as applicable, except that from and after the Effective Time (i)HP and its compensation committee will be substituted for the Company and the compensation committee of the Company’s board administering such Company Stock Plans; (ii)the Restricted Stock Units assumed by HP will represent the right to receive shares of HP common stock (or cash, if permitted under the terms of the applicable Restricted Stock Units or as required by law) upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units promptly after vesting (except to the extent the terms of the applicable Restricted Stock Unit provide for deferred settlement, in which case settlement will be in accordance with the specified terms); and (iii)the number of shares of HP common stock subject to the Restricted Stock Units will equal the number of shares of

our common stock subject to the applicable Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and HP will convert any remaining fractional share into the right to receive cash based on the Parent Closing Price.

Pursuant to the individual market stock unit agreements, at the Effective Time, the (i)number of Earned MSUs will be determined by shortening the performance period to end upon the Effective Time and (ii)a participant will vest in the number of Earned MSUs equal to (A)(1) the number of fully completed calendar months that have elapsed from the commencement of the performance period set forth in the market stock unit agreements through the Effective Time, _divided by_ (2)the total number of months in the original performance period (notwithstanding the Merger), _multiplied by_ (B)the Earned MSUs, with the result rounded down to the nearest whole share. The Earned MSUs that vest at the Effective Time will receive the Merger Consideration. The Earned MSUs that do not vest under the individual market stock unit agreements on the Effective Time will be converted into Restricted Stock Units of HP at the Effective Time (with the adjustments described in the paragraph above) and will vest in equal quarterly installments at the end of each three month period following the Effective Time, with the number of quarterly vesting dates equal to (i)(A) the total number of months in the original performance period set forth in the market stock unit agreement (notwithstanding the Merger) _less_ (B)the number of fully completed calendar months that have elapsed from the commencement of the performance period through the Effective Time, _divided by_ (ii)three (rounded down to the nearest whole number). However, 100% of the Earned MSUs that are unvested as of the last day of the original performance period will vest on the last day of the original performance period, unless vested earlier. The market stock units that do not become Earned MSUs will be forfeited at the Effective Time.

ESPP

Any current offering period as of the date of the Merger Agreement will be the final offering period under the ESPP. After the date of the Merger Agreement, no new participants will be permitted to join any current offering period in progress under the ESPP and no ESPP participant will be permitted to increase his or her contributions or the amount of withholding elections with respect to any current offering period. The ESPP will terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall shorten the duration of any then-current offering period under the ESPP and purchase shares of our common stock with all amounts withheld on behalf of the participants. All outstanding shares of common stock purchased under the ESPP and held by an individual as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled as of the Effective Time and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash, without interest, and less any applicable withholding taxes. All amounts withheld that have not been used to purchase our common stock at or prior to the Effective Time will be returned to the participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the ESPP upon the termination of the ESPP.

**[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1173752/000119312515118977/d882720ddefm14a.htm)Exchange and Payment Procedures**

Promptly after the Effective Time, HP will deposit or cause to be deposited with a bank or trust company designated by HP and reasonably acceptable to Aruba, which we refer to as the “paying agent”, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to stockholders pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which we refer to as the “payment fund”. In the event that the payment fund becomes insufficient to make such payments, from time to time following the Effective Time, HP shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the paying agent additional cash in any amount necessary to enable the paying agent to pay any and all Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the surviving corporation will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate that, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, represented outstanding shares of common stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, which we refer to as a “certificate”, (1)a letter of transmittal and (2)instructions advising stockholders how to surrender certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof.

Upon surrender to the paying agent of a certificate along with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be required by the paying agent, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each share formerly represented by such certificate (other than with respect to dissenting shares and excluded shares), subject to deduction for any required holding tax and without interest.

Certificates should not be surrendered by stockholders prior to the Effective Time and should be sent only pursuant to instructions set forth in the letters of transmittal to be mailed to stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. In all cases, the Merger Consideration will be provided only in accordance with the procedures set forth in such letters of transmittal.

The letter of transmittal will include instructions of the procedures to be taken by a holder of a certificate if such holder has lost a certificate or if such certificate has been stolen or destroyed. In the event any certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then before such stockholder will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, such stockholder will have to make an affidavit, in form reasonably acceptable to HP, of the loss, theft or destruction, and if required by HP or the paying agent, deliver a bond in such amount as HP or the paying agent may determine as reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate.

Promptly after the Effective Time and, in any event, no later than the third business day after the Effective Time, the surviving corporation will cause the paying agent to issue and send to each holder of uncertificated shares of common stock represented by book entry, which we refer to as “book-entry shares” (other than with respect to dissenting shares and excluded shares), a check or wire transfer for the amount of cash that the holder of such book-entry shares is entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement (subject to deduction for any required withholding tax and without interest) with respect to such book-entry shares. Holders of book-entry shares will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent.

If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate or book-entry share is registered, then, as a condition of payment of the Merger Consideration, (i)with respect to any such certificate, the surrendered certificate is properly endorsed or is otherwise in proper form for transfer and (ii)with respect to any such book-entry shares, such book-entry shares have been properly transferred and, in the case of each of (i)and (ii), the person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such certificate or book-entry shares or shall have established to the satisfaction of HP that such tax is not applicable.

Each certificate or book-entry share will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Any Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of any certificate or in respect of book-entry shares will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to that certificate or such book-entry shares and the shares formerly represented by such certificate or book-entry shares. The stock transfer books of Aruba will be closed at the effective time of the Merger and, if after the Effective Time, certificates are presented to the surviving corporation or the paying agent for transfer or transfer is sought for book-entry shares, such certificate or book-entry shares will be cancelled and exchanged for Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to applicable law in the case of any dissenting shares.

Any portion of the payment fund (including any interest or other income earned on such cash) that is not distributed to holders of certificates or book-entry shares six months following the Effective Time will be delivered to the surviving corporation upon demand, and any remaining holders of certificates or book-entry shares will thereafter look only to the surviving corporation as general creditors for payment of the Merger Consideration (subject to applicable law and without interest).

Any portion of the funds deposited with the paying agent for payment for shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected will be returned to HP upon demand; however, HP is not required to deposit with the paying agent cash to pay Merger Consideration with respect to shares of common stock for which the holder has delivered a notice or demand of appraisal that has not been withdrawn prior to the closing date but HP will be required to pay the Merger Consideration for any shares whose holder has failed to perfect or withdraws or loses such appraisal rights or to pay the appraised value of any dissenting shares for which such appraisal rights are perfected in accordance with Section 262, as applicable. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger — Appraisal Rights_”.

If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your shares held in “street name”.

_Withholding_

Parent, the surviving corporation, Aruba, Merger Sub and the paying agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares of Aruba’s common stock, stock options or restricted stock units such amounts for taxes that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to making such payment under all applicable tax laws.

The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of Aruba, HP and Merger Sub.

Some of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by Aruba are qualified as to “materiality” or “Material Adverse Effect.” For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect to Aruba, any event, change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or state of facts that (A)is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), or results of operations of Aruba and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B)materially impairs the ability of Aruba to consummate, or prevents or materially delays, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or would reasonably be expected to do so; provided, however, with respect to clause (A)above, Material Adverse Effect shall not include any events, changes, circumstances, occurrences, effects and states of fact to the extent resulting from the following:

•changes or conditions generally affecting the industries in which Aruba and its subsidiaries operate, or the economy or the financial or securities markets in the United States or any other region in the world, or regulatory and political conditions in the United States or any other region in the world;

•the outbreak or escalation of war (whether or not declared) or acts of terrorism, or the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters;

•changes or prospective changes in Law, GAAP or accounting standards, or any changes or prospective changes in the interpretation or enforcement of any of the foregoing, in each case after the date of the Merger Agreement;

•the announcement or pendency of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the impact thereof on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers, suppliers, distributors, partners, employees, or Governmental Entities (it being understood that the foregoing exclusion will not apply to any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Aruba in the Merger Agreement that is expressly intended to address the consequences of the execution, delivery or performance of the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby);

•any failure, in and of itself, by Aruba and its subsidiaries to meet any internal or published budgets, projections, forecasts or predictions of financial performance for any period, or any changes in the

price or trading volume of Aruba common stock (it being understood that this clause will not prevent a party from asserting that any underlying event, change, circumstance, occurrence, effect and state of facts that may have contributed to such failure independently constitutes or contributes to a Material Adverse Effect); or

•any matters expressly set forth in Aruba’s disclosure letter

provided, that, with respect to matters described in the first three bullets above, the impact of such events, changes, circumstances, occurrences, effects and states of fact will not be disregarded to the extent that such impact disproportionately adversely impacts Aruba and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other participants in the industries in which Aruba and its subsidiaries operate.

In the Merger Agreement, Aruba has made representations and warranties to HP and Merger Sub that are subject, in some cases, to specified exceptions and qualifications contained in the Merger Agreement. These representations and warranties relate to, among other things:

•due organization, valid existence, good standing (or similar concept) and authority and qualification to conduct business with respect to Aruba and its subsidiaries;

•the delivery of true and complete copies of Aruba’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and minutes or the most recent draft minutes of meetings of Aruba’s stockholders and the Board of Directors;

•Aruba’s corporate power and authority to enter into and perform the Merger Agreement, and the enforceability of the Merger Agreement;

**_Acquisition Proposals; Change in the Recommendation of Aruba’s Board of Directors_**

Aruba has agreed that it will not, nor will it permit or authorize any of its subsidiaries or any of its representatives, directly or indirectly, to:

•enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information or data with respect to any Acquisition Proposal;

•make an adverse recommendation change, except as described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—_Change in the Recommendation of Aruba’s Board of Directors_” below; or

Any violation of the restrictions, procedures and agreements set forth in the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement by any representative of Aruba or any of its subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of Aruba or any of its subsidiaries, or otherwise, will be deemed to be a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement by Aruba.

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, this covenant will not prohibit Aruba, at any time prior to obtaining the approval of the Merger Agreement of its stockholders, from (x)furnishing information (including non-public information) regarding Aruba and its subsidiaries to a person making an Acquisition Proposal (subject to the execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to Aruba than, those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (including the “standstill” provisions contained therein) and (y)participating in discussions and negotiations with the person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal if:

•its Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below); and

•its Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take the actions described in clauses (x)and (y)above would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Aruba under applicable law.

In the event that Aruba enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, Aruba is required pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement to provide to HP (i)a non-redacted copy of each confidentiality agreement into which Aruba has entered into in accordance with the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement and (ii)any non-public information provided to any person who has made that applicable Acquisition Proposal. No commercially or competitively sensitive non-public information may be provided to such person except in accordance with “clean room” or similar procedures consistent in all material respects with Aruba’s practices in dealing with the disclosure of such information to HP and its representatives in connection with the negotiation of the Merger Agreement.

In addition to any obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement with regard to the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, Aruba has agreed to promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of receipt, advise HP in writing (including via e-mail) in the event that Aruba or any of its subsidiaries or representatives receives (i)any indication that any person is considering an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)any inquiry or request for information, discussion or negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead to or contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii)any proposal or offer that is or is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case together with a description of the material terms and conditions of and facts surrounding any such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, the identity of the person making any such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, and a copy of any written proposal, offer or draft agreement provided by such person. In each case, Aruba has further agreed to (i)keep HP reasonably informed in writing (including via e-mail) in all material respects on a timely basis of the status and details (including, within 24 hours of any amendment or modification to any Acquisition Proposal), including furnishing any relevant copies and written summaries of any material oral inquiries or discussions and (ii)promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify HP if it decides to begin providing information or engaging in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal and will not begin providing such information or engaging in such discussions prior to providing such notice. Under the Merger Agreement, HP is entitled to at least 24 hours prior notice (or shorter, if such shorter notice is provided to the Board) of any meeting of the Board at which the Board is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal.

In addition to the obligations set forth above, Aruba has also agreed that it will not:

•enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the date of the Merger Agreement that would restrict Aruba’s ability to comply with any of the terms of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, and will cause its subsidiaries not to take the foregoing action; and

•take any action to exempt any person (other than HP, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) from the restrictions on “business combinations” contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar provision of any other takeover law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case unless such actions are taken substantially concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company in order to accept a Superior Proposal in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.

asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, licensing or similar transaction, or otherwise, of (i)assets or businesses of Aruba and its subsidiaries that generate 15% or more of the net revenues or net income (for the twelve-month period ending on the last day of Aruba’s most recently completed fiscal quarter) or that represent 15% or more of the total assets (based on fair market value) of Aruba and Aruba’s subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, (ii)15% or more of any class of capital stock, other equity securities or voting power of Aruba or any resulting parent company of Aruba, or (iii)15% or more of any class of capital stock, other equity securities or voting power of any one or more of Aruba’s subsidiaries which collectively generate 15% or more of the net revenues or net income (for the twelve-month period ending on the last day of Aruba’s most recently completed fiscal quarter) or collectively hold 15% or more of the total assets (based on fair market value) of Aruba and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, in each case other than the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

As described in this proxy statement, “Superior Proposal” means any unsolicited bona fide binding written Acquisition Proposal that is fully financed or has fully committed financing, that its Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal (including the likelihood that the transaction contemplated thereby will be completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis) and the person making the proposal, is more favorable to the stockholders of Aruba from a financial point of view than the Merger (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by HP in response to such proposal); provided, that, for purposes of this definition of “Superior Proposal,” references in the term “Acquisition Proposal” to “15%” shall be deemed to be references to “50%”.

As described in this proxy statement, “Intervening Event” means a material event or circumstance that was not known or reasonably foreseeable to its Board of Directors prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, which event or circumstance, or any material consequence thereof, becomes known to its Board of Directors prior to the receipt of approval for the Merger Agreement by Aruba’s stockholders, and does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal.

_Change in the Recommendation of Aruba’s Board of Directors_

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors has agreed that neither it, nor any of its committees, will (i)withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to HP or Merger Sub) the recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors or any such committee of the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated thereby; (ii)recommend or otherwise declare advisable the approval by Aruba’s stockholders of any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii)resolve, agree or propose to take any of the above listed actions, each of the foregoing, we refer to as an “adverse recommendation change”. The Board of Directors has further agreed that neither it, nor any of its committees, will cause or permit Aruba or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other contract, in each case constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, each of the foregoing, we refer to as an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”, except for an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, or resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Aruba is permitted to take and disclose a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; however, any such disclosure (with the exception of any “stop, look and listen” communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) will be deemed an adverse recommendation change unless the Board expressly (i)reaffirms its recommendation to Aruba’s stockholders in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger and (ii)rejects any applicable Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining approval of the Merger Agreement by Aruba stockholders, if it determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders of Aruba under applicable law, taking into account all adjustments to the terms of the Merger Agreement that may be offered by HP, the Board of Directors may (i)make an adverse recommendation change in response to either a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event or (ii)solely in response to a Superior Proposal received after the date of the Merger Agreement that was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, cause Aruba to terminate the agreement and enter into a binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal.

In the case of each of (i)and (ii)above, the Board of Directors may only make an adverse recommendation change in response to a Superior Proposal or terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement if:

•Aruba has notified HP in writing at least five business days prior to taking the action of its intent to take such action and specifies the reasons for such action, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity, of the person making the Superior Proposal and attaches a copy, if any, of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant transaction documents and, in the event of any amendment to the financial terms or other material term of such Superior Proposal, new written notice by Aruba and a new two calendar day period shall be required; and

•HP does not make, within such five business day (or two calendar day, as applicable) period, an offer or proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement capable of being accepted by Aruba as a binding agreement and the Board of Directors, after taking into condition the adjusted terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that the Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and that a failure to make an adverse recommendation change or terminate the Merger Agreement, as applicable, would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Aruba under applicable law.

In the case of (i)above, the Board of Directors may only make an adverse recommendation change in response to an Intervening Event if:

•Aruba has provided HP with written information describing the Intervening Event in detail;

•Aruba has notified HP in writing at least five business days before making an adverse recommendation change with respect to such Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifies the reasons for such adverse recommendation change; and

•if HP does not make an offer or proposal capable of being accepted by Aruba as a binding agreement during such five business day period to adjust the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the Board of Directors, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement as offered or proposed, determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to make such adverse recommendation change would result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of Aruba under applicable law.

Aruba has agreed that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, neither Aruba or any of its subsidiaries will enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (except an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms (including payment of any applicable termination fee, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “_The Merger Agreement — Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fees_”).

Aruba may adjourn the stockholders’ meeting without HP’s consent solely if (i)there is an absence of a quorum; (ii)whether or not a quorum is present, Aruba has received insufficient proxies to represent the number of shares to constitute the Company Stockholder Approval (provided, that, in the case of each of (i)and (ii),Aruba may only adjourn the stockholders’ meeting two times); or (iii)the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (in consultation with outside legal counsel) that a reasonable time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure is necessary under applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, at the request of HP, Aruba has agreed that, at the request of HP, it will adjourn the stockholders’ meeting one time to a date specified by HP for the absence of a quorum or if insufficient proxies to constitute the Company Stockholder Approval have been received by Aruba. Such adjournment cannot be required to be for a period exceeding ten business days or for any period that would require Aruba to select a different record date for the stockholders’ meeting and, further, HP cannot exercise the foregoing right to adjournment if Aruba has already adjourned the stockholders’ meeting pursuant to clauses (i)and (ii)in the preceding paragraph.

**_Access to Information; Confidentiality_**

Until the Effective Time or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, subject to certain express exceptions, Aruba will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, provide to HP, Merger Sub and their respective representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours to Aruba’s and its subsidiaries’ respective properties (subject to Aruba’s and its subsidiaries’ reasonable security measures but excluding the right to perform any invasive testing or sampling), assets, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and shall furnish promptly to HP certain information, including copies of reports and other documents filed or received pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and such other information as HP or Merger Sub may reasonably request; provided, that Aruba shall not be required to disclose any information that would contravene applicable law or cause the waiver of any legal privilege.

**_Required Efforts to Consummate the Merger_**

Subject to certain exceptions described below and the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Aruba, HP and Merger Sub have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, and no later than ten days following the date of the Merger Agreement in the case of filings under the HSR Act, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including (i)obtaining all required consents, approval or waivers from, or participation in other discussions or negotiations with, third parties, including as required under any material contract and (ii)obtaining all necessary actions, nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from any governmental entities, make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings and make all reasonable best efforts to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any action by, any governmental entity, including filings under the HSR Act.

Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, the parties have agreed that HP shall not be required to (i)agree or proffer to divest or hold separate, or take any other action with respect to, any of the assets or businesses of HP or any of its affiliates or the Surviving Corporation (assuming the Merger is consummated), (ii)agree or proffer to limit in any manner whatsoever or not to exercise any rights of ownership of any securities (including shares of Aruba’s common stock) or (iii)enter into any agreement that in any way limits the ownership or operation of any business of HP, Aruba, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates.

**_Anti-Takeover Statutes_**

Aruba has agreed not to take any action to cause any anti-takeover law to become applicable to the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated thereby. If any anti-takeover law or similar law is or becomes applicable to the Merger Agreement, the Merger, or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Aruba’s Board of Directors has agreed to take all actions necessary, to the extent permitted under such law, to ensure that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.

**_Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance_**

HP and Merger Sub have agreed that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current or former directors and officers of Aruba and each subsidiary of Aruba as provided in Aruba’s charter or bylaws (and comparable governing documents of the subsidiaries of Aruba that have been delivered and made available to HP prior to the date of the Merger Agreement) as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time will be assumed and performed by the Surviving Corporation and will continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of such acts or omissions, except as otherwise required by applicable law.

For a period of six years after the Effective Time, HP will cause to be maintained in effect Aruba’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering each person currently covered by Aruba’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy (a correct and complete copy of which was made available to HP before the execution of the Merger Agreement) for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, that HP may (i)substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than Aruba’s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement (ii)request that Aruba obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time); and provided, further, that in no event shall HP or Aruba be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under these provisions in excess of 150% of the amount of the annual premiums paid by Aruba for fiscal year 2014 for such purpose (which fiscal year 2014 premiums were represented and warranted by Aruba to be as set forth in Aruba’s disclosure letter), it being understood that HP shall nevertheless be obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained for such 150% amount. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Merger Agreement, Aruba may purchase a six-year “tail” prepaid policy on Aruba’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, provided, that the aggregate cost for such “tail” policy shall not exceed 250% of the amount of the annual premiums paid by Aruba for fiscal year 2014 for such purpose. In the event that Aruba elects to purchase such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and HP will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of the Surviving Corporation (and HP) under the first sentence of this paragraph for so long as such “tail” policy shall be maintained in full force and effect (subject to the proviso in the preceding sentence).

**_Litigation Related to the Merger_**

Aruba has agreed to give HP the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation against Aruba and/or its officers or directors relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Aruba must obtain HP’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) prior to entering into any settlement agreement related to such litigation.

**_Employee Benefits_**

Aruba will terminate, effective as of the day immediately preceding the date Aruba becomes a member of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as HP, any and all 401(k) plans maintained by Aruba or any of its subsidiaries.

HP has agreed to allow all employees of the Company who remain employees of HP or any subsidiary of HP to participate in the benefit programs of HP or the subsidiary to the same extent as similarly situated employees of HP or the subsidiary. In the U.S., such employees who become employees of HP will be given credit for all service with the Company or its U.S. subsidiaries solely for the purposes of determining their rate of vacation accrual under HP’s standard vacation program; service credit for all other purposes will begin at the Effective Time. Outside the U.S., such employees who become employees of a subsidiary of HP shall be given credit for service with the Company or its subsidiaries solely as required by applicable law. From and after the Effective Time, HP will (i)cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under the U.S. group health plans of HP or its subsidiaries to be waived with respect to continuing employees and their eligible dependents and (ii)give each of the continuing employees in the U.S. credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs toward applicable deductibles and annual out of pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made. Unused vacation days accrued by U.S. continuing employees under the plans and policies of Aruba and its subsidiaries will carry over to HP or the Surviving Corporation to the extent administratively practicable, and each such continuing employee will be paid by Aruba in cash for any accrued and unused vacation days that HP determines are not administratively practicable to carry over. The actions specified in this section will not operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any employee.

For the period of time beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, HP and its subsidiaries will honor, in accordance with their terms, all existing employment, change of control, severance and retention arrangements between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including any non-continuing employee whose employment is terminated prior to the Effective Time); provided, however, that HP and its subsidiaries may terminate the employment of any continuing employee and may amend or terminate any such plans or agreements in accordance with the terms of such plans and/or agreements.

The Company will terminate any and all group severance, separation, deferred compensation, or salary continuation plans, programs, policies, or arrangements (other than as described above) maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable law.

**_Other Covenants_**

The Merger Agreement contains other covenants, including those relating to stock exchange delisting and deregistration, notices of certain events, the resignation of officers and directors of Aruba, public announcements and matters related to reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock, as of April 2, 2015, of each person or entity who we know to beneficially own 5% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock and all of our current directors and executive officers as a group.

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person, and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to stock options held by that person that are currently exercisable, or exercisable within 60 days of April 2, 2015, are deemed outstanding. Such shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Unless otherwise indicated below, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table is c/o Aruba Networks, Inc., 1344 Crossman Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089.

The percentages in the table below are based on approximately 109,756,185 shares of common stock outstanding as of April 2, 2015. Except as indicated in the footnotes to this table and pursuant to applicable community property laws, to our knowledge, each stockholder named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares set forth opposite such stockholder’s name. The information provided in this table is based on our records and information filed with the SEC, unless otherwise noted.

(b) Vested Options. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option to purchase Shares granted under any Company Stock Plan that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder of any such cancelled vested Company Stock Option as soon as practicable following the Effective Time an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i)the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such vested Company Stock Option and (ii)the number of Shares subject to such vested Company Stock Option; provided, that if the exercise price per Share of any such vested Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such vested Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.

(c) Restricted Stock Units. Each award of restricted stock units (“Company RSUs”) representing the right to receive one Share for each Company RSU granted under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company RSU that becomes vested as a result of the consummation of the Merger and is settled in Shares that, in turn, converts into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)) and is held by a person providing services to the Company or its Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become rights with respect to Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume the Company RSUs, in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plans and/or restricted stock unit agreement by which each Company RSU is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i)Parent and the Parent Compensation Committee shall be substituted for Company and the compensation committee of the Company Board administering such Company Stock Plans, (ii)the Company RSUs assumed by Parent shall represent the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (or cash, if so provided under the terms of such Company RSU or required under applicable Law) upon settlement of such Company RSU promptly after vesting (except to the extent the terms of the applicable restricted stock unit agreement provide for deferred settlement, in which case settlement shall be in accordance with the specified terms) and (iii)the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each award of Company RSUs shall be equal to the number of Shares subject to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and in any event Parent shall convert any remaining fractional share into the right to receive cash based on the Parent Closing Price (except that in no event shall any vesting restrictions applicable to a Company RSU be accelerated unless so provided under the terms of such Company RSU or other Company Plan). For avoidance of doubt, any market stock units granted by the Company will be included in the definition of “Company RSUs”.

actions necessary so that the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall shorten the duration of any then current offering period under the Company ESPP and purchase Shares with all amounts withheld by the Company on behalf of the participants in the Company ESPP as of such date. Any Shares so purchased shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.1 above. All amounts withheld by the Company on behalf of the participants in the Company ESPP that have not been used to purchase Shares at or prior to the Effective Time will be returned to the participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP upon the termination of the Company ESPP.

(f) Reservation of Shares; Registration Statement.

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”), in trust for the benefit of holders of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders to the extent they hold Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares), cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a) (such cash, the “Payment Fund”). From time to time following the Effective Time as required, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent additional cash in any amount necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay any and all Merger Consideration payable hereunder, to the extent the Payment Fund shall become insufficient to make such payments. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to this Article II.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate (“Certificates”) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i)a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and contain such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify) and (ii)instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate (other than Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares) the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate (subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the third Business Day thereafter, the Surviving

Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to issue and send to each holder of uncertificated Shares represented by book entry (“Book-Entry Shares”), other than with respect to Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares, a check or wire transfer for the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in respect of such Book-Entry Shares, without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration.

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax is not applicable.

(d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Article II, without any interest thereon.

(e) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

(f) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent, on a daily basis; provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard& Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon demand.

(g) Any portion of the Payment Fund (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any remaining holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (except to the extent representing Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws), without interest.

(h) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been exchanged prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(j) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.1(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected as described in Section 2.5 shall be returned to Parent, upon demand; provided, that the parties acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required under this Section 2.3 or otherwise to deposit with the Paying Agent any cash to pay Merger Consideration with respect to Shares as to which its holder has purported to deliver a notice or demand of appraisal that has not been withdrawn prior to the Closing Date; provided, further, that this Section 2.3(j) shall not relieve Parent of any obligation to pay the Merger Consideration for any Shares whose holder has failed to perfect or withdraws or loses such right to appraisal, or to pay for the appraised value for any Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent determines it is required to deduct and withhold under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (“Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holder’s right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other instruments received by the Company relating to rights to appraisal, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, “Material Adverse Effect” means any event, change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or state of facts (any such item, an “Effect”) that (A)is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B)materially impairs the ability of the Company to consummate, or prevents or materially delays, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to do so; provided, however, that in the case of clause(A) only, Material Adverse Effect shall not include any Effect to the extent resulting from (1)changes or conditions generally affecting the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, or the economy or the financial or securities markets in the United States or any other region in the world, or regulatory and political conditions in the United States or any other region in the world, (2) the outbreak or escalation of war (whether or not declared) or acts of terrorism, or the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters, (3)changes or prospective changes in Law, GAAP or accounting standards, or any changes or prospective changes in the interpretation or enforcement of any of the foregoing, in each case after the date hereof, (4)the announcement or pendency of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the impact thereof on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers, suppliers, distributors, partners, employees, or Governmental Entities (it being understood that this clause (4)shall not apply to any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company herein that is expressly intended to address the consequences of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), (5)any failure, in and of itself, by the Company and its Subsidiaries to meet any internal or published budgets, projections, forecasts or predictions of financial performance for any period, or any changes in the price or trading volume of the Shares (it being understood that this clause (5)shall not prevent a party from asserting that any underlying Effect that may have contributed to such failure independently constitutes or contributes to a Material Adverse Effect), or (6)any matters expressly set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter; provided, that, with respect to clauses(1), (2)and (3), the impact of such Effect shall not be disregarded to the extent that such impact disproportionately adversely impacts the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other participants in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

(c) The Company has previously delivered or made available to Parent true and complete copies of the Company’s certificate of incorporation (the “Company Charter”) and bylaws (the “Company Bylaws”), in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered or made available is in full force and effect.

(A) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least five Business Days before taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a copy (if any) of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Company and a new two calendar day period); and

(B) if Parent makes an offer or proposal capable of being accepted by the Company as a binding agreement during such five Business Day (or two calendar day, as applicable) period to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as offered or proposed by Parent, determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement, as applicable, would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

provided, further, that the Company Board may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event unless:

(1) the Company provides Parent with written information describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail;

(2)the Company notifies Parent in writing at least five Business Days before making an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifies the reasons therefor; and

(3) if Parent makes an offer or proposal capable of being accepted by the Company as a binding agreement during such five Business Day period to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as offered or proposed by Parent, determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

During the five Business Day period (or two calendar day period, as applicable) prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement as referred to above, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement offered or proposed by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (except an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms (including the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(b), if applicable).

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.2(a) and Section 5.2(b), the Company promptly (and in any event within twenty-four hours of receipt) shall advise Parent in writing (including, for this purpose, via electronic mail) in the event the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i)any indication by any Person that it is considering making an Acquisition Proposal,

Without limiting any of the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four hours) notify Parent in writing (including, for this purpose, via electronic mail) if it determines to begin providing information or to begin engaging in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.2(b) and shall in no event begin providing such information or begin engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice. The Company shall provide Parent with at least twenty-four hours prior notice (or such shorter notice as may be provided to the Company Board) of a meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal.

(d) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.2 by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

(e) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would restrict the Company’s ability to comply with any of the terms of this Section 5.2.

(g) Nothing contained in Section 5.2(a) shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e–2(a), Rule 14d–9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M–A promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that any such disclosure (other than a “stop, look and listen” communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d–9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change (including for purposes of Section 7.1(c)(ii)) unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation to the Company’s stockholders in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger in such disclosure and expressly rejects any applicable Acquisition Proposal.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) “Acquisition Proposal” means any proposal or offer with respect to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase or license, in one transaction or a series of transactions, and whether through any merger, reorganization, consolidation, tender offer, self-tender, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, licensing or similar transaction, or otherwise, of (A)assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries that generate 15% or more of the net revenues or net income (for the twelve-month period ending on the last day of the Company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter) or that represent 15% or more of the total assets (based on fair market value) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy (a correct and complete copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, that Parent may (i)substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof or (ii)request that the Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time); and provided, further, that in no event shall Parent or the Company be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under this Section 5.8(b) in excess of 150% of the amount of the annual premiums paid by the Company for fiscal year 2014 for such purpose (which fiscal year 2014 premiums are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be as set forth in Section 5.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter), it being understood that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained for such 150% amount.

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to any

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall permit all employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who remain employees of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent (“Continuing Employees”) to participate in the benefit programs of Parent or the Subsidiary to the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent or the Subsidiary. In the U.S., such employees who become employees of Parent shall be given credit for all service with the Company or its U.S. Subsidiaries solely for the purposes of determining their rate of vacation accrual under Parent’s standard vacation program; service credit for all other purposes shall begin at the Effective Time. Outside the U.S., such employees who become employees of a Subsidiary of Parent shall be given credit for service with the Company or its Subsidiaries solely as required by applicable Law.

(c) Section 5.14(b) shall not operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any employee, require Parent to continue in effect any specific Company employee benefit plan or Parent employee benefit plan, or prohibit the termination of any specific employee, following the Effective Time. Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i)shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (ii)shall alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

(d) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, all existing employment, change of control, severance and retention arrangements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand (including, for avoidance of doubt, any non-Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated prior to the Effective Time); provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or its Subsidiaries from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee or amending or terminating any such plans or agreements, so long as such amendment or termination complies with the terms of any such plans or agreements, including specifically obtaining any necessary or required consents.

(e) The Company shall terminate any and all group severance, separation, deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, programs, policies or arrangements (other than as described or disclosed in Section 5.14(d) above) maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, effective in each case no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law.

March 1, 2015

Board of Directors

Aruba Networks, Inc.

1344 Crossman Ave.

Sunnyvale, CA 94089

Members of the Board:

We understand that Aruba Networks, Inc. (the “Company”), Hewlett-Packard Company (“Parent”), and Aspen Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated as of February 28, 2015 (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”). Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and each outstanding share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Company Common Stock”), other than shares held in treasury of the Company or owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, and shares as to which appraisal rights have been properly demanded, will be converted into the right to receive $24.67 in cash. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

You have asked for our opinion as to whether the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, other than Parent or any affiliates of Parent, (the “Holders”), pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.

For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft, dated February 28, 2015, of the Merger Agreement (the “Draft Merger Agreement”), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-looking information prepared by management of the Company, including financial projections and operating data of the Company (collectively, the “Company Projections”). Additionally, we discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior executives of the Company. We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock and compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections, we have been advised by the management of the Company, and have assumed, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered thereby. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Draft Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. We also have assumed that the final executed Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the Draft Merger Agreement reviewed by us. In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions

will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, we have relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will receive a fee for our services payable upon rendering of this opinion. We will also receive an additional, larger fee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst or any of its affiliates and the Company or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst or its affiliates; however, Qatalyst and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or Parent and their respective affiliates for which we would expect to receive compensation.

Qatalyst provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of corporations and individuals, domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.

This opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose without our prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any Holder should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company Common Stock will trade at any time.

Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be received by the Holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement and we express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the consideration to be received by the Holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.

Yours faithfully,

QATALYST PARTNERS LP

**APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS**

**DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW**

**§ 262. Appraisal rights.**

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d)of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d)of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b)and (c)of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i)listed on a national securities exchange or (ii)held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under §251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4)In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d)and (e)of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted for the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting corporation.”

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d)and (e)of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b)or (c)of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the tender or exchange offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i)each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii)the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more

than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the tender or exchange offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a)and (d)of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a)and (d)of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d)of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a)of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing

appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f)of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d)of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e)of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e)of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e)of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
