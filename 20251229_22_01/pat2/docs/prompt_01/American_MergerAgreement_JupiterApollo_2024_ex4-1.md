Apollo shall reasonably cooperate with Jupiter and the Exchange Agent in connection with the appointment of the Exchange Agent, and the conversion of the Outstanding Apollo Securities pursuant to this Agreement (including the provision of any information, or the entry into any agreements or documentation, necessary or advisable, as determined in good faith by Jupiter, or otherwise requested by the Exchange Agent to fulfill its duties as the Exchange Agent in connection with the Transactions). Jupiter shall bear all costs and expenses (if any) of the Exchange Agent.

(b) Exchange Procedures.

(i) On the Closing Date and prior to the Effective Time, Jupiter shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Outstanding Apollo Securities, for exchange in accordance with this Article III, the number of shares of Jupiter Common Stock sufficient to deliver the Aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement (such shares of Jupiter Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the “Merger Consideration”).

7

(ii) Jupiter shall cause the Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to pay such Per Share Merger Consideration out of the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Payment Schedule and the other applicable provisions contained in this Agreement. The Merger Consideration shall not be used for any other purpose.

(iii) The payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to any Participating Securityholder shall be expressly conditioned upon such Participating Securityholder providing a completed Letter of Transmittal, and if requested, written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Jupiter that such Participating Securityholder is an “accredited investor” as defined and determined pursuant to Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

(iv) If the Merger Payment Schedule is delivered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with Section 3.2(b) on or prior to the date that is (A) at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then Jupiter and Apollo shall take reasonable steps to cause the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration to be issued to the applicable holder of Outstanding Apollo Securities in book-entry form as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event more than five (5) Business Days, following the Closing Date, or (B) less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then Jupiter and Apollo shall take all necessary actions to cause the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration to be issued to the applicable holder of Outstanding Apollo Securities in book-entry form within five (5) Business Days after such delivery; provided that the Per Share Merger Consideration shall not be issued with respect to shares of Outstanding Apollo Securities represented by a Certificate until the applicable holder of such Outstanding Apollo Securities has surrendered such Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and satisfied the conditions of Section 3.2(b)(iii).

(c) No Further Rights in Outstanding Apollo Securities. The Per Share Merger Consideration issuable upon conversion of the Outstanding Apollo Securities in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Outstanding Apollo Securities.

(d) Adjustments to Per Share Merger Consideration. The Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into shares of Jupiter Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, merger, sale or exchange of shares or other like change with respect to shares of Apollo Common Stock, Apollo Preferred Stock or Jupiter Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(e) Termination of Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains undistributed to any Participating Securityholder for failure to satisfy the conditions of Section 3.2(b)(iii) for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Jupiter, upon demand, and any Participating Securityholder who has not theretofore complied with this Section 3.2 shall thereafter look only to Jupiter for such holder’s portion of the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of Outstanding Apollo Securities (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by the BCA, become the property of Jupiter free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

8

(f) No Liability. None of the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Company shall be liable to any Participating Securityholder for any Jupiter Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of Jupiter, Apollo, the Surviving Company, and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts (including shares, options or other property) otherwise payable, issuable or transferable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment, issuance or transfer under the BCA. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with the BCA, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid, issued or transferred to the Participating Securityholder (or intended recipients) in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. The parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith to eliminate or reduce any such deduction or withholding.

(h) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Jupiter Common Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of the Outstanding Apollo Securities in the Merger and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Jupiter. In lieu of any fractional share of Jupiter Common Stock to which any holder of Outstanding Apollo Securities would otherwise be entitled, the Exchange Agent shall round up or down to the nearest whole share of Jupiter Common Stock, as applicable, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up. No cash settlements shall be made with respect to fractional shares eliminated by rounding.

(i) Merger Payment Schedule. At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Apollo shall deliver to Jupiter and the Exchange Agent a schedule (the “Merger Payment Schedule”) of record holders of the Outstanding Apollo Securities and the number of shares of Jupiter Common Stock to be delivered to each such beneficial owner in accordance with Section 3.1(a). Apollo agrees that Jupiter and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on information set forth in the Merger Payment Schedule and any amounts delivered by Jupiter or the Exchange Agent to an applicable Participating Securityholder in accordance with the Merger Payment Schedule shall be deemed for all purposes to have been delivered to the applicable Participating Securityholder in full satisfaction of the obligations of Jupiter under this Agreement and Jupiter shall not be responsible or liable for the calculations or the determinations regarding such calculations set forth therein.

Section 3.3 **Dissenting Shares**. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 3.1, the Outstanding Apollo Securities that are held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised its appraisal rights of such Outstanding Apollo Securities in accordance with the BCA (such shares being referred to collectively as the “Dissenting Shares” until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder’s appraisal rights under the BCA with respect to such shares) shall not be cancelled for no consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by the BCA; provided, however, that if after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder’s right to appraisal pursuant to the BCA, such Outstanding Apollo Securities shall immediately be deemed to have converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration issuable in respect of such Outstanding Apollo Securities pursuant to Section 3.1(a) as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares, and Jupiter shall issue to the holder thereof the portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares. Apollo shall provide Jupiter prompt (but in any event within one (1) Business Day) written notice of any demands received by Apollo for appraisal of any Outstanding Apollo Securities, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to Apollo prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the BCA that relates to such demand. Jupiter shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Jupiter, Apollo shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Apollo shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Outstanding Apollo Securities thereafter on the records of Apollo.

Section 4.8 **Indemnification**. Each of Apollo, on the one hand, and Jupiter on the other hand (as applicable, the “Indemnitor”), will indemnify and hold Jupiter and Apollo, respectively (as applicable, the “Indemnitee”), and its directors, officers, shareholders, members, partners, employees and agents (and any other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title), each Person who controls the Indemnitee (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, shareholders, agents, members, partners or employees (and any other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title) of such controlling Persons (each, a “Indemnitee Party”) harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, costs and expenses, including all judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of investigation that any such Indemnitee Party may suffer or incur as a result of or relating to (a) any breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by the Indemnitor in this Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents, (b) any action instituted against the Indemnitee Parties in any capacity, or any of them or their respective Affiliates, by any stockholder of the Indemnitor who is not an Affiliate of such Indemnitee Parties, with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (unless such action is based upon a breach of such Indemnitee Party’s representations, warranties or covenants under the Transaction Documents or any agreements or understandings such Indemnitee Parties may have with any such stockholder or any violations by such Indemnitee Parties of state or federal securities Laws or any conduct by such Indemnitee Parties which constitutes fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or malfeasance) or (c) in the case of indemnification of Jupiter by Apollo, for any demand for appraisal under the BCA (which shall include amounts paid to stockholders of Apollo with respect to such demands in excess of such stockholder’s portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement). If any action shall be brought against any Indemnitee Party in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnitee Party shall promptly notify the Indemnitor in writing, and the Indemnitor shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee Party. Any Indemnitee Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnitee Party except to the extent that (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnitor in writing, (ii) the Indemnitor has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to employ counsel or (iii) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of counsel, a material conflict on any material issue between the position of the Indemnitor and the position of such Indemnitee Party, in which case the Indemnitor shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one such separate counsel. The Indemnitor will not be liable to any Indemnitee Party under this Agreement (y) for any settlement by such Indemnitee Party effected without the Indemnitor’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; or (z) to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to such Indemnitee Party’s breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by the Indemnitor in this Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents. The indemnification required by this Section 4.8 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or are incurred. The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to any cause of action or similar right of any Indemnitee Party against the Indemnitor or others and any liabilities the Indemnitor may be subject to pursuant to Law.

Section 4.9 **Confidentiality; Public Disclosure**. Each party agrees not to disclose or use any Confidential Information of the other party without the prior written authorization of such other party; provided, however, that a party may disclose Confidential Information (i) to such party’s professional advisors that are subject to a duty of confidentiality and with such party’s investors to communicate information about the subject matter of this Agreement and other customary information to investors in connection with the operation of their respective investment and management businesses in the ordinary course of business or in connection with their respective fund raising, marketing, informational or reporting activities subject to customary confidentiality obligations; (ii) if any such information is necessary for enforcing such party’s rights under this Agreement; or (iii) if such disclosure is required by the BCA, subpoena, court order, regulation, or judicial or administrative process; provided that, to the extent practicable and permitted by the BCA, such party provides notice of such requirement to the other party for the purpose of enabling the first party to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent such disclosure. For the avoidance of doubt, Jupiter may disclose this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and Transactions pursuant to Section 4.3 without the consent of Apollo.

Section 4.10 **Further Actions**. From time to time, as and when reasonably requested by a party hereto, the other party will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and will take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions, as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, in any such case, at the requesting party’s sole cost and expense.
