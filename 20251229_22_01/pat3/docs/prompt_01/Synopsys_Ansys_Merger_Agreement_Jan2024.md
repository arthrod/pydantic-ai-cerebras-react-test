**AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

**T HIS****A GREEMENT AND P LAN OF M ERGER**(this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of January 15, 2024, by and among: **S YNOPSYS, I NC.**, a Delaware corporation (“Parent”); **ALTA A CQUISITION C ORP****.**, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”); and **A NSYS, I NC.**, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

**R ECITALS**

**A.**Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “Merger”) in accordance with this Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”). Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist and the Company will become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

**B.**The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved this Agreement and the Merger.

**A GREEMENT**

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

**Section 1.T HE T RANSACTION**

**1.1****The Merger**. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause Merger Sub to be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”).

**1.2****Effects of the Merger**. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

**1.3****Closing****; Effective Time**. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall consummate the Contemplated Transactions (the “Closing”) by means of a virtual closing through electronic exchange of signatures at 8:00 a.m. (California Time) on a date to be jointly designated by Parent and the Company, which shall be no later than the 15 th calendar day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Section 6 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), or at such other place, time or date as Parent and the Company may agree in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the 15 th calendar day referred to in the preceding sentence is not a Business Day, then, subject to the continued satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 6 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), the date to be jointly designated by Parent and the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be no later than the first Business Day after the 15 th calendar day referred to in the preceding sentence. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the “Closing Date.” The Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing by the Company and Merger Sub of a duly executed certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be mutually agreed by Parent and the Company in writing and specified in such certificate of merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective being referred to as the “Effective Time”).

* * *

**1.4****Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers**. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time:

**(a)**at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to conform to Exhibit B;

**(b)**at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall conform with the rights and responsibilities of the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement, including the provisions of Section 5.6; and

**(c)**the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who were the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary corporate action to cause two Designated Directors to become members of the board of directors of Parent as of the Effective Time; _provided_ that (i)prior to the Effective Time, each Designated Director shall have completed Parent’s director nomination process and shall have satisfied all applicable eligibility requirements of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of Parent’s board of directors, (ii)for purposes of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, each Designated Director will become a member of the Parent board of directors immediately following the Effective Time and (iii)if the Effective Time occurs less than six months prior to the next annual meeting of Parent’s stockholders, Parent shall nominate each Designated Director for election at such meeting (unless such person is unable or unwilling to serve as a result of illness, death, resignation or other reason). For purposes of this Agreement, “Designated Director” means a member of the board of directors of the Company that is selected by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company to become a member of the board of directors of Parent.

**1.5****Conversion of Shares**.

**(a)**At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company:

**(i)**any shares of Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unaffected by the Merger and shall remain outstanding as an equal number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

**(ii)**any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company (or held in the Company’s treasury) or held, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

2

* * *

**(iii)**except as provided in Sections 1.5(a)(i) and 1.5(a)(ii), and subject to Sections 1.5(b), 1.5(c), 1.5(d), 1.7 and 1.8, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive (A) 0.3450 (the “Exchange Ratio”) of a share of Parent Common Stock and (B) $197.00 in cash, without interest (the “Per Share Cash Amount”); and

**(iv)**each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

**(b)**If, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending at the earlier of (i)the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 and (ii)the Effective Time (the “Pre-Closing Period”), the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by the Company during the Pre-Closing Period, or a record date with respect to any such event occurs during the Pre-Closing Period, then the Exchange Ratio and the Per Share Cash Amount will be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. If, during the Pre-Closing Period, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by Parent during the Pre-Closing Period, or a record date with respect to any such event occurs during the Pre-Closing Period, then the Exchange Ratio (but not the Per Share Cash Amount) will be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

**(c)**No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional share shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder hereunder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share, upon surrender of such holder’s Company Stock Certificate(s) or the transfer of Uncertificated Company Shares, be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Parent Stock Exchange on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

**(d)**If the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger (including all shares of Parent Common Stock which may be issued after the Effective Time pursuant to Converted Options, Converted RSUs and Assumed Shares) would exceed 19.9999% of the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Maximum Share Number”), (i)the Exchange Ratio shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (rounded down to four decimal places) such that the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger (including all shares of Parent Common Stock which may be issued after the Effective Time pursuant to Converted Options and Converted RSUs and Assumed Shares) does not exceed the Maximum Share Number (the amount of such reduction in the Exchange Ratio, the “Exchange Ratio Reduction Amount”) and (ii)the Per Share Cash Amount shall be increased by an amount equal to (A)the closing trading price of Parent Common Stock on the Parent Stock Exchange for the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, multiplied by (B)the Exchange Ratio Reduction Amount (rounded down to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 1.5(d) shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any right of Parent to invoke the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6, or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, if Parent would otherwise have such right under Section 6 or Section 7.1, respectively.

**1.6****Closing of the Company****’****s Transfer Books**. At the Effective Time: (a)except for shares of Company Common Stock that continue to be held by a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time in accordance with Section 1.5(a)(i), all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such certificate, a “Company Stock Certificate”) or uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry positions (each such share, an “Uncertificated Company Share”) shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b)the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.7.

**1.7****Exchange of Company Stock Certificates**.

**(a)**On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select Parent’s transfer agent (after consultation with the Company) or another reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the “Exchange Agent”). At or promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent: (i)certificates or book-entry positions representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii); and (ii)cash sufficient to make payments of the cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii) (including payments to be made in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(c)). The Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to the deposited shares of Parent Common Stock are referred to collectively as the “Exchange Fund.” In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 1.5, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund. Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (A)held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and (B)applied promptly to make payments pursuant to Section 1.5. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 1.5, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent.

**(b)**Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the Persons who, as of the Effective Time, were record holders of Company Stock Certificates: (i)a notice advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger; (ii)a letter of transmittal in customary form as reasonably acceptable to each of Parent, the Company and the Exchange Agent (including a provision confirming that delivery of a Company Stock Certificate will be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Company Stock Certificate will pass, only upon proper delivery of such Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent); and (iii)instructions for use in effecting the surrender

* * *

of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with the delivery of a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent in connection with the surrender of such Company Stock Certificate, (A)Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that the holder of such Company Stock Certificate is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii) in exchange therefor, in non-certificated book-entry form in the name of such holder, and to mail to such Person, as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter, (1)a statement reflecting the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock so issued and (2)a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 1.7(i)) of the cash consideration that the holder of such Company Stock Certificate is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii) (including payments to be made in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(c) and any unpaid dividends or distributions that such Person has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.7(c), as applicable), in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificate, and (B)the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b), each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 1.5.

**(c)**Any holder of Uncertificated Company Shares will not be required to deliver a Company Stock Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Uncertificated Company Shares. Upon receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary form after the Effective Time with respect to such holder, (i)Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to (A)issue the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii) in exchange therefor, in non-certificated book-entry form in the name of such holder, and (B)mail to such Person, as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter, (1)a statement reflecting the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock so issued and (2)a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 1.7(i)) of the cash consideration that the holder of such Uncertificated Company Shares is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii) (including payments to be made in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(c) and any unpaid dividends or distributions that such Person has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.7(c), as applicable), in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Uncertificated Company Shares, and (ii)the Uncertificated Company Shares so transferred shall be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall accept transferred Uncertificated Company Shares upon compliance with such reasonable instructions as the Exchange Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. Until transferred as contemplated by this Section 1.7(c), each Uncertificated Company Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 1.5.

**(d)**No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share that has not been transferred, in each case with respect to the Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the Merger, until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate or transfers such Uncertificated Company Share in accordance with this Section 1.7 (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws, to receive all such dividends and distributions, without interest).

5

* * *

**(e)**In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock which are not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the holder in whose name the Company Stock Certificate formerly representing such shares or Uncertificated Company Shares is registered if: (i)any such Company Stock Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer; and (ii)such holder has paid any fiduciary or surety bonds and any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of such Merger Consideration to a Person other than such holder (or has established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such bonds and Taxes have been paid or are not applicable).

**(f)**If any Company Stock Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Stock Certificates or in respect of Uncertificated Company Shares.

**(g)**Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to former holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of the date that is 12 months after the date on which the Merger becomes effective will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates, or complied with the procedures established by the Exchange Agent for transfer of Uncertificated Company Shares, in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Merger Consideration.

**(h)**If any Company Stock Certificate has not been surrendered, or any Uncertificated Company Share has not been transferred, by the earlier of (i)the fifth anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective and (ii)the date immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration that such Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share represents the right to receive would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body, then such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.

**(i)**Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled (i)to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted or withheld) from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any Legal Requirement and (ii)to timely request any necessary Tax forms to minimize any such deductions or withholdings, including IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar forms, from the Company or any other Person before a payment is made to the Company or such other Person, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid to the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

6

* * *

**1.8****Dissenting Shares**.

**(a)**Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a proper demand for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and who has otherwise complied with all applicable provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as “Dissenting Shares” until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder’s appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5(a)(iii), but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares.

**(b)**If any Dissenting Shares lose their status as such (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, effective as of the later of the Effective Time and the date of loss of such status, such shares will be deemed automatically to have been converted into, and shall represent only, the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5(a)(iii), without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate representing such shares or, if such shares are Uncertificated Company Shares, upon compliance with the procedures established by the Exchange Agent for the transfer of such Uncertificated Company Shares, in each case in accordance with Section 1.7.

**(c)**The Company shall give Parent: (i)prompt notice of any demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL and relating to any demand for appraisal; and (ii)the opportunity to participate in (but not direct) all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument relating to any demand for appraisal. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless Parent has given its prior written consent to such payment or settlement offer.

**1.9****Further Action**. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of the Company and Merger Sub, then the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized (in the name of the Company, in the name of Merger Sub or otherwise) to take such action.

**(l)**neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any “closing agreement” as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar state, local or foreign Legal Requirement), and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested, has received or is subject to any written ruling of a Governmental Body or has entered into any similar written agreement with a Governmental Body with respect to any Taxes; and

**3.14****Financing**_._

**(a)**Parent has delivered to the Company a copy of the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement (the “Debt Commitment Letter”), by and among Parent, Bank of America, N.A., BofA Securities, Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., HSBC Bank USA, National Association, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (together with any financing sources added in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and hereof, the “Financing Sources”), pursuant to which the Financing Sources have committed, subject solely to the conditions expressly set forth therein and the terms thereof, to provide the amounts set forth therein for purposes of funding the Contemplated Transactions on the date on which the Closing is to occur pursuant to Section 1.3 (the “Debt Financing”). Parent has also delivered to the Company a copy of any fee letter with any Financing Source (redacted in a customary manner to mask only the fees payable to the Financing Sources in respect of the Debt Financing, the rates and amounts included in the “market flex” provisions and other economic terms that would not (i)reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability of the Debt Financing or to reduce the amount thereof to be less than the amount required to comply with the representation in Section 3.14(b) relating to the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii)impose any new condition or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing or (iii)delay or prevent the Closing Date (the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), collectively, the “Prohibited Conditions”)) (any such fee letter, a “Fee Letter”).

38

* * *

**(b)**Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, the aggregate net proceeds from the Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, together with all other sources of cash available to Parent on the Closing Date, will be sufficient for the payment of all of its obligations under this Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter, including the payment of the Merger Consideration, and all costs and expenses of the Contemplated Transactions payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger, and any repayment or refinancing of indebtedness contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (collectively, the “Financing Uses”).

**(c)**As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded, or amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived in any respect. The Debt Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies directly or indirectly related to the funding of the full amount (or any portion) of the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, constitutes, or could constitute, a breach, default or failure to satisfy a condition under the Debt Commitment Letter by or on the part of Parent or, to Parent’s knowledge, any other party to the Debt Commitment Letter under the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts, arrangements or understandings of any kind (written or oral) directly or indirectly related to the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter that contains a Prohibited Condition. Parent has fully paid all commitment fees and other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent is not, and has no reason to be, aware of any fact, event or other occurrence that makes any of the representations or warranties in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate in any respect. As of the date of this Agreement, no Person that is a party to the Debt Commitment Letter has notified Parent (or any of its Affiliates or Representatives) of its intention to terminate any of its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter or to not provide the Debt Financing.

**(d)**As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Closing pursuant to Section 6, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter will not be satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date or that the full amount of the Debt Financing required to satisfy the Financing Uses will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date.

**(e)**Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that their respective obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner whatsoever upon obtaining the Debt Financing in the amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses.

**3.15****Solvency**. Assuming (a)the representations and warranties contained in Section 2 are accurate as of the date of this Agreement and will be accurate as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date (in each case, disregarding all “Material Adverse Effect” and other materiality and similar qualifications limiting the scope of such representations and warranties), (b)the satisfaction of all of the conditions contained in Section 6, (c)immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Acquired Companies are Solvent (substituting references to “Parent” and “following the Closing” in such definition with references to “the Company” and “prior to the Effective Time”, respectively), immediately following the Closing, after giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions, Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), taken as a whole, will be Solvent. As used herein, “Solvent” means, with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately following the Closing, that: (i)the fair value of the property of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately following the Closing is greater than the total amount of liabilities, including, contingent liabilities, of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately following the Closing; (ii)the present fair salable value of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately following the Closing is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on their debts as they become absolute and matured; (iii)immediately following the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, do not have outstanding debts or liabilities beyond their ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature; and (iv)immediately following the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are not engaged in a business or a transaction, and are not proposing to engage in a business or a transaction, for which Parent’s and its Subsidiaries’ property, taken as a whole, would constitute an unreasonably small amount of capital. The amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed under this Section 3.15 as the amount that, in the light of all the facts and circumstances existing immediately following the Closing, is probable to become an actual or matured liability.

**3.16****Disclosure**. None of the information to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent specifically for inclusion in the Form S-4 Registration Statement will, at the time the Form S-4 Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. None of the information to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the time the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by any Acquired Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

**3.17****No Other Representations**. Parent, on behalf of itself and the Parent Entities, including Merger Sub, acknowledges that: (a)except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Section 2, in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(c), neither the Company nor any of the other Acquired Companies (or any other Person) makes, or has made, any representation or warranty relating to the Acquired Companies or any of their businesses or operations in connection with this Agreement or the Merger; and (b)the representations and warranties made by the Company in Section 2 and in the certificate

40

delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(c) are in lieu of and are exclusive of all other representations and warranties made by the Company, including any express or implied warranties as to merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, and the Company disclaims any other or implied representations or warranties, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure by or on behalf of the Company of any other information (including any financial information, supplemental data or financial projections or other forward-looking statements) to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives. Parent and Merger Sub further acknowledge that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Section 2, in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(c), they have not relied on or otherwise been induced by: (i)any express or implied representation or warranty relating to the Acquired Companies or any of their businesses or operations in connection with this Agreement or the Merger; (ii)any estimate, projection, prediction, data, financial information, memorandum, presentation or other materials or information provided or addressed to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives; or (iii)the accuracy or completeness of any other representation, warranty, estimate, projection, prediction, data, financial information, memorandum, presentation or other materials or information.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent upon becoming aware (A)any material Legal Proceeding or material claim threatened, commenced or asserted against any of the Acquired Companies or (B)of any written notice from a Person alleging consent of such Person is required in connection with the Merger as a result of a contract or any arrangement between such Person and any Acquired Company.

**(f)**The Company acknowledges and agrees that any action taken by any Representative of any Acquired Company which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of any provision set forth in this Section 4.3 or Section 5.2 shall be deemed to constitute a breach of such provision by the Company.

Any Converted RSU issued pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company RSU prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however_, that (A)all references to the “Company” in each Company Equity Plan and each award agreement shall be deemed to be references to Parent and (B)to the extent that such Company RSU is a Company PSU, the performance metrics applicable to such Company PSU shall not apply from and after the Effective Time.

**(e)**At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Person, each Specified RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled and extinguished, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes, or other amounts required by applicable Legal Requirements to be withheld) (x)the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5(a)(iii) on the same terms and conditions as outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (y)an amount in cash equal to any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents with respect to each Specified RSU; _provided_, _however_, that the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to those Specified RSUs that are Company PSUs shall be determined based on the attainment of applicable performance metrics at the (x)actual level of performance for performance periods that lapsed in the ordinary course prior to the Effective Time or (y)for each other such Company PSU, greater of the target or actual level of performance, as determined by the Company’s board of directors or a committee thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 5.3(e) shall be made by the Surviving Corporation within 10 Business Days after the Effective Time; _provided_, that, to the extent that any payment within such time or on such date would trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A, such payment shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty; _provided, further_, that notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Specified RSU granted to a non-employee member of the Company’s board of directors that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A and that the Company determines prior to the Effective Time is not eligible to be terminated in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), such payment will be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Company Equity Plan that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A. The aggregate amount required to be withheld in respect of Taxes in respect of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Specified RSUs pursuant to this Section 5.3(e) shall be applied first to reduce the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in shares of Parent Common Stock and then, only if and to the extent that such withholding amount exceeds such stock portion, to reduce the portion of the Merger Consideration that is payable in cash (if any). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be withheld shall be determined based on the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date.

56

* * *

**(f)**If requested by Parent in writing prior to the Effective Time, any shares of Company Common Stock that remain available for issuance pursuant to any Company Equity Plans as of the Effective Time (or any portion thereof requested by Parent) (the “Residual Shares”) shall be converted at the Effective Time into the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of such Residual Shares and the Conversion Ratio (such shares of Parent Common Stock, the “Assumed Shares”).

**(g)**Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions set forth in this Section 5.3; _provided, however_, that no such action taken shall be required to be irrevocable until immediately prior to the Effective Time. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than five (5)Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to Converted Options and Converted RSUs, in each case that are eligible to be registered on Form S-8, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Converted Options and Converted RSUs assumed in accordance with this Agreement remain outstanding. The Company shall assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement and provide Parent with all information reasonably requested by Parent for such preparation.

**5.4****Treatment of Company ESPP**. As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take all action that may be necessary to provide that: (a)no new offering period (or similar period during which shares may be purchased) shall commence under the Company ESPP following the date of this Agreement; (b)participants in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may not increase their payroll deductions under the Company ESPP from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; and (c)no new participants may commence participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such action as may be necessary to: (i)cause any offering period (or similar period during which shares may be purchased) in progress as of the date of this Agreement to be the final offering period under the Company ESPP and to be terminated no later than five Business Days prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs; (ii)make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period (or similar period), but otherwise treat such shortened offering period (or similar period) as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP; (iii)cause each participant’s then-outstanding share purchase right under the Company ESPP (the “Company ESPP Rights”) to be exercised as of no later than two Business Days prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs (such date, the “Final Exercise Date”); and (iv)terminate the Company ESPP as of, and subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Time. On the Final Exercise Date, the funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP within the associated accumulated payroll withholding account for each participant under the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP (as amended pursuant to this Section 5.4), and each share purchased thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5(a)(iii), subject to withholding of any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes. Any accumulated contributions of each participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares in

57

* * *

accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP (as amended pursuant to this Section 5.4), be refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following the Final Exercise Date (without interest). No further Company ESPP Rights shall be granted or exercised under the Company ESPP after the Final Exercise Date. The Company shall provide timely notice to participants of the setting of the Final Exercise Date and the termination of the Company ESPP in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP.

**5.5****Employee Benefits****and Employee Matters**.

**(a)**Subject, and in addition, to the requirements imposed by applicable Legal Requirements, during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the “Continuation Period”), Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or their respective Affiliates shall provide each Continuing Employee with (i)total target cash compensation (to be defined as base salary or annualized base wage rate, plus target annual cash incentive opportunity) to each Continuing Employee that is no less than the total target cash compensation provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii)retirement and health and welfare benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.

**(b)**During the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to provide, severance payments and benefits to each Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated during such period that are no less favorable than the severance payments and benefits that such Continuing Employee would have been eligible to receive upon a termination of employment under any applicable severance plan, policy, practice or arrangement sponsored or maintained by the Acquired Companies (as listed on Part 2.16(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or otherwise as permitted pursuant to Part 4.2(b)(xi) of the Company Disclosure Schedule).

**(c)**As of the Closing Date, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or one of their respective Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to each Continuing Employee under each employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or one of their Affiliates in which such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing Date (the “Post-Closing Plans”), credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) for full or partial years of service with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries performed at any time prior to the Closing Date to the extent such service was taken into account under the analogous Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_, _however_, that no such prior service shall be taken into account to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits to any such Continuing Employee.

**(d)**For purposes of each Post-Closing Plan providing medical, dental, prescription drug and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i)all pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements, actively-at-work requirements, and waiting periods for such Post-Closing Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or requirements were waived or were inapplicable under the analogous Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date, and to the extent consistent with the governing terms of the Post-Closing Plan and (ii)such Continuing Employees to be given credit under such Post-Closing Plans for co-payments made, and deductibles satisfied, prior to the Closing Date for the year in which the Closing Date occurs.

58

* * *

**(e)**Except for Indemnified Persons (to the extent of their rights pursuant to Section 5.6), no Company Associate shall be deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.5 shall limit the effect of Section 8.8.

**(f)**Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions that may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the Closing Date, any Company Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a “Company 401(k) Plan”). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Company’s board of directors of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent), effective no later than the day prior to the Closing Date. In such event, prior to the Closing Date and thereafter (as applicable), the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take any and all action as may be required, including amendments to a U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (each, a “Parent 401(k)Plan”), to permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4)of the Code) in cash or notes (representing plan loans from the Company 401(k) Plan) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account balance distributable to such Continuing Employee from such Company 401(k)Plan to the corresponding Parent 401(k)Plan. If the Company 401(k)Plan is terminated as described herein, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in a Parent 401(k)Plan as soon as reasonably practicable on or following the Closing Date. If the distributions of assets from the trust of any Company 401(k) Plan that is terminated pursuant to this Section 5.5(f) are reasonably anticipated to cause or result in liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees to be imposed upon the account of any participant or beneficiary of such Company 401(k) Plan or upon the Company or any participating employer, then the Company shall estimate in good faith the amount of such charges or other fees and provide its estimate of that amount in writing to Parent at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

**(g)**To the extent any employee, union, works council or other employee representative information, notification or consultation requirements are imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to any of the Contemplated Transactions, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to ensure that such information, notification or consultation requirements are complied with in all material respects prior to the Effective Time. Prior to making any broad-based notices or communications to any employees of the Acquired Companies, the parties shall provide, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to provide, all broad-based employee notices or communication materials (including website postings) that are intended to be provided to the employees of the Acquired Companies and that relate to their terms or conditions of employment, including compensation or benefits matters following the Closing (the “Employee Communications”) to other party for its prior review and the reviewing party shall have the right to provide timely and reasonable comments to any such notices or communications, which will be considered in good faith. The foregoing shall not apply to any Employee Communications to the extent the substance of statements contained therein are consistent in all material respects with previous Employee Communications made by the Company or Parent after prior review by the other party.

**5.6****Indemnification of Officers and Directors**.

**(a)**From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to exculpate, indemnify and hold harmless (and shall also cause the Surviving Corporation to advance expenses as incurred), (i)to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, and (ii)in accordance with any indemnification agreements with any Acquired Company in effect on the date of this Agreement, each present and former director and officer of any Acquired Company (collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Persons’ service as a director or officer of any Acquired Company or services performed by such Persons at the request of any Acquired Company at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including with respect to (A)the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions and (B)actions to enforce this Section 5.6.

**(b)**All rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement and reimbursement of expenses by any Acquired Company existing in favor of the Indemnified Persons for their acts and omissions as directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Company’s or the applicable Acquired Company’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other similar organizational documents (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided in those indemnification agreements between an Acquired Company and such Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement), will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect (to the extent such rights to indemnification are available under and consistent with applicable law) for a period of six years following the date on which the Merger becomes effective, and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Acquired Companies in respect of such rights of indemnification, exculpation and advancement and reimbursement of expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if any Indemnified Person notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Indemnified Person intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.6, the provisions of this Section 5.6 shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.

**(c)**From the date on which the Effective Time occurs until the sixth anniversary of such date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions as directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement in the form Made Available to Parent (the “Existing D&O Policy”), except that: (i)Parent may substitute for the Existing D&O Policy a policy or policies of substantially comparable coverage, and in any event, coverage not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policies of the Acquired Companies; and (ii)Parent will not be required to pay annual premiums for the Existing D&O Policy (or for any substitute policies) in excess of 300% of the most recent annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement for the Existing D&O Policy (the “Maximum Premium”). If any future annual premiums for the Existing D&O Policy (or any substitute policy therefor) exceed the Maximum Premium in the aggregate, then Parent may reduce the amount of coverage of such Existing D&O Policy (or any substitute policy therefor) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have the right to purchase a pre-paid,non-cancellable “tail” policy on the Existing D&O Policy for a claims reporting or discovery period of six (6)years from the Closing Date and otherwise on terms and conditions that are no less favorable than the terms and conditions of the Existing D&O Policy; _provided, however_, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to, and the Company shall not (without the prior written consent of Parent), expend an amount for such “tail” policy in excess of the Maximum Premium. If such “tail” policy is purchased, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect in lieu of all other obligations of the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this Section 5.6(c).

**(d)**The provisions of this Section 5.6 are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by each of the Indemnified Persons, who are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.6 from and after the Effective Time.

**(e)**In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)consolidates with or merges into any Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume of the rights and obligations set forth in this Section 5.6.

**5.7****Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters**.

**(a)**Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file, as soon as practicable and advisable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, and to submit promptly any additional information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i)the Company and Parent shall: (A)(1) within 10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, make an appropriate filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act, (2)prepare, file and submit the notifications, reports and other documents (or, if appropriate, drafts of documents) required under any applicable foreign antitrust or competition laws or regulations in the jurisdictions set forth on Part 5.7(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule as soon as reasonably practicable and advisable and (3)promptly after the date of this Agreement, prepare, file and submit the notifications, reports and other documents required under (x)any applicable Foreign Investment Laws in the jurisdictions set forth on Part 5.7(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and (y)the NISPOM Rule (including notification to the DCSA and, as required, any other cognizant security authority pursuant to the NISPOM Rule), in each case, in connection with the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions; and (B)respond as promptly as practicable to (1)any inquiries or requests received from the FTC or the DOJ for additional information or documentation and (2)any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust, foreign direct investment, security clearance or related matters; and (ii)except to the extent Parent determines otherwise: (A)the Company and Parent shall (1)promptly (and in any event within 10 Business Days) after a Requesting Authority asserts or attempts to assert jurisdiction over, or requests, requires or attempts to require a filing or submission relating to, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions, consult with one another in good faith to determine whether such filing is required and, if Parent determines such filing is required to consummate the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions, file and submit (in accordance with each Legal Requirement that may be applicable or that such Requesting Authority asserts to be applicable) all notices, reports and other documents required or requested by such Requesting Authority to be filed or submitted, in each case, promptly after Parent makes such determination; and (2)respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests received from

**(f)**by Parent if: (i)any of the Company’s representations or warranties contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement or shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date) such that any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2 would not be satisfied (it being understood that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations or warranties as of the date of this Agreement or as of any subsequent date, (A)all “Material Adverse Effect” and other materiality and similar qualifications limiting the scope of such representations or warranties (other than dollar thresholds) shall be disregarded, and (B)any update of or modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made after the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be disregarded); or (ii)any of the Company’s covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in Section 6.2(b) would not be satisfied; _provided_,_however_, that: (A)if an inaccuracy in any of the Company’s representations or warranties as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement or a breach of a covenant or obligation by the Company is curable by the Company prior to the End Date and the Company is continuing to exercise its reasonable best efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(f) on account of such inaccuracy or breach unless such inaccuracy or breach shall not have been cured by the Company on or prior to the earlier of (x)the Business Day immediately prior to the End Date and (y)30 days after the date on which Parent gives the Company written notice of such inaccuracy or breach; and (B)Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(f) if Parent is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) to be satisfied;

**(g)**by the Company (at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote) in order to accept a Superior Offer and enter into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such Superior Offer that has been executed on behalf of the Person that made such Superior Offer (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”), only if: (i)the Company shall have complied with Section 4.3 in all material respects; (ii)the Company’s board of directors, after satisfying the requirements set forth in Section 5.2(e)(i), shall have authorized the Company to enter into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement; (iii)the Company shall have delivered to Parent a written notice (that includes a copy of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement as an attachment) confirming that the Company will enter into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement in the form attached to such notice concurrently with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g); (iv)concurrently with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g), the Company enters into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Offer; and (v)immediately prior to or concurrently with such termination, the Company shall have paid to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee; or

**(h)**by the Company if: (i)any of Parent’s representations or warranties contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement, or shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date) such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) would not be satisfied (it being understood that, for

purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations or warranties as of the date of this Agreement or as of any subsequent date, (A)all “Material Adverse Effect” and other materiality and similar qualifications limiting the scope of such representations or warranties (other than dollar thresholds) shall be disregarded, and (B)any update of or modification to the Parent Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made after the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be disregarded); or (ii)if any of Parent’s covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in Section 6.3(b) would not be satisfied; _provided_,_however_, that: (A)if an inaccuracy in any of Parent’s representations or warranties as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement or a breach of a covenant or obligation by Parent is curable by Parent prior to the End Date (as it may be extended in accordance with Section 7.1(b)) and Parent is continuing to exercise its reasonable best efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(f) on account of such inaccuracy or breach unless such inaccuracy or breach shall not have been cured by Parent on or prior to the earlier of (x)the Business Day immediately prior to the End Date and (y)30 days after the date on which the Company gives Parent written notice of such inaccuracy or breach; and (B)the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(h) if the Company is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) to be satisfied.

**7.2****Effect of Termination**. If this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 7.1, all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall terminate, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect and there shall be no liability on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective stockholders or Representatives; _provided_,_however_, that: (a)this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Section 8 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect; (b)the Confidentiality Agreement (as modified pursuant to Section 4.1(b)) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; and (c)the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any liability for fraud or any knowing and intentional breach of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, “knowing and intentional breach” means a material breach of or failure to perform a covenant or obligation that is a consequence of an intentional act undertaken by the breaching party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act would reasonably be expected to cause a material breach of this Agreement.

**7.3****Expenses; Termination Fees**.

**(a)**Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

**(b)**If: (i)this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b) (prior to the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 6.1(c)) or Section 7.1(d); (ii)at or prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement, but on or after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or made and such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been publicly withdrawn at least 10 calendar days prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting (or, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b), an Acquisition Proposal shall otherwise exist and shall not have been withdrawn); and (iii)within 12 months after the date of such termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not relating to such Acquisition Proposal) is consummated or a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not related to such Acquisition Proposal) is executed, then the Company shall pay to Parent a non-refundable fee in the amount of $950,000,000 (the “Termination Fee”) in cash; _provided_,_however_, that, for purposes of clause “(iii)” of this Section 7.3(b), all references to “15%” and “85%” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” shall be deemed to be references to “50%”.

76

* * *

**(c)**If this Agreement is terminated: (i)pursuant to Section 7.1(e); (ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(d) at any time after the occurrence of a Triggering Event; or (iii)pursuant to Section 7.1(g), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee in cash.

**(d)**If this Agreement is terminated: (i)pursuant to Section 7.1(c) as a result of a Regulatory Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body under any applicable antitrust or competition Legal Requirement or any applicable Foreign Investment Law in any jurisdiction identified in Part 5.7(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule or (ii)pursuant to Section 7.1(b) and, at the time of termination, all conditions set forth in Section 6 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived, other than those conditions set forth in Section 6.1(d), Section 6.1(e), Section 6.1(f) and Section 6.1(g) (solely in connection with any applicable antitrust law or regulation or Foreign Investment Law in the jurisdictions identified on Part 5.7(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule), then Parent shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Company a non-refundable fee in the amount of $1,500,000,000 (such non-refundable fee being referred to as the “Reverse Termination Fee”) in cash within two Business Days after the date of such termination.

**(e)**Any Termination Fee required to be paid to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(b) shall be paid by the Company within two Business Days after the earlier to occur of the consummation of, or entry into a definitive agreement relating to, the Acquisition Transaction contemplated by Section 7.3(b). Any Termination Fee required to be paid to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(c)(i) or Section 7.3(c)(ii) shall be paid by the Company (i)in the case of a termination of this Agreement by the Company, at or prior to the time of such termination, and (ii)in the case of a termination of this Agreement by Parent, within two Business Days after such termination. Any Termination Fee required to be paid to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(c)(iii) shall be paid immediately prior to or concurrently with, and as a condition to, the termination of this Agreement.

**(f)**Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall Parent or the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee under this Section 7.3 on more than one occasion, whether or not such fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that (i)the covenants and obligations contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions, and that, without these covenants and obligations, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement, and (ii)neither the Termination Fee nor the Reverse Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (A)except in the case of fraud or a knowing and intentional breach of any of Parent’s covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, the Company’s right to receive the Reverse

77

Termination Fee from Parent in the circumstances under which such fee is payable pursuant to this Section 7.3(plus, if the Reverse Termination Fee is not timely paid, the interest, costs and expenses described in Section 7.3(g)) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against Parent and Merger Sub and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or agents (each such Person, a “Parent Related Party”) for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any other Parent Related Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement; and (B)except in the case of fraud or a knowing and intentional breach of any of the Company’s covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, Parent’s right to receive the Termination Fee from the Company in the circumstances under which such fee is payable pursuant to this Section 7.3(plus, if the Termination Fee is not timely paid, the interest, costs and expenses described in Section 7.3(g)) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent against the Acquired Companies and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or agents (each such Person, a “Company Related Party”) for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Acquired Companies or any other Company Related Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7.3(f) shall limit the rights of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company under Section 8.11 (or otherwise with respect to injunctive or similar relief), in each case prior to the termination of this Agreement.

**(g)**If the Company or Parent fails to pay when due any amount payable under this Section 7.3, then (i)such party shall reimburse the other party for all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and the enforcement by the other party of its rights under this Section 7.3 (it being understood and agreed that neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to reimburse the other party for any premium, success fee, contingent fee or other similar fee, commission or payment incurred by the other party in connection with the collection of such overdue amount or the enforcement by the other party of its rights under this Section 7.3) and (ii)such party shall pay interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to the other party in full) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Prime Rate in effect on the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

**(h)**Any fee or other amount payable pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be paid free and clear of all deductions and withholdings.

**(i)**Without limiting the rights of Parent under the Debt Commitment Letter or the rights of any of the Parent Entities under any Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, the Company agrees that none of (i)the Financing Sources or (ii)any of their respective Affiliates or any of such Financing Sources’ or their Affiliates’ respective former, current or future general or limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, agents, officers, directors, employees, accountants, advisors or representatives or any of their respective successors or assigns (the Persons described in this clause “(ii)” being collectively referred to as the “Financing Source Related Parties”) shall have any liability or obligation to Parent, the Company, any of their respective stockholders, Affiliates, Representatives, current, former or future officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, stockholders, managers or members relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions (including the Debt Financing and Debt Commitment Letter), whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. This Section 7.3(i) shall not affect, alter or amend in any way the covenants and agreements between the Company and Parent, or the obligations of the Company and Parent, provided for in this Agreement.

**8.10****Severability**. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision. In the event that the parties are unable to agree to such replacement, the parties agree that the court making the determination referred to above shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so modified.

**8.11****Remedies**. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement required to be performed by any of the parties were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, any non-breaching party shall be entitled to obtain, without proof of actual damages (and in addition to any other remedy to which such non-breaching party may be entitled at law or in equity): (a)a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation; and (b)an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. Each of the parties hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. The parties further agree not to assert that (a)a remedy of specific performance or an injunction is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason or (b)a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.

**8.12****Construction**.

**(a)**For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine genders.

**(c)**As used in this Agreement, the words “include,” “including” and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” All references in this Agreement to “dollars” or “$” shall mean United States Dollars. The phrase “to the extent” means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and does not simply mean “if.”

**(d)**Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires: (i)any definition of or reference to any agreement, instrument or other document or any Legal Requirement in this Agreement shall be construed as referring to such agreement, instrument or other document or Legal Requirement as from time to time amended, supplemented or otherwise modified; (ii)any reference in this Agreement to any Person shall be construed to include such Person’s successors and assigns; (iii)all references to “Sections,” “Schedules” and “Exhibits” in this Agreement or in any Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement, respectively; (iv)the words “herein,” “hereof,” “hereunder” and words of similar import, shall be construed to refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; and (v)any statute defined or referred to in this Agreement shall include all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

**(e)**The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

**(f)**The Company shall be deemed to have “Knowledge” of a fact or other matter if any individual listed in Part 1.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule has actual knowledge (and not constructive or imputed knowledge) of such fact or other matter.
