Splunk Inc.

October 30, 2023

Dear Splunk Stockholder:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof, the “Special Meeting”) of holders of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Splunk Inc. (“Splunk common stock,” and the holders thereof “Splunk Stockholders”), a Delaware corporation (“Splunk” or the “Company”), to be held on November 29, 2023, at 2:00 p.m., Pacific time. Splunk will hold the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SPLK2023SM. You will not be able to attend the Special Meeting physically in person. For purposes of attendance at the Special Meeting, all references in this proxy statement to “present” or “in person” shall mean virtually present at the Special Meeting.

At the Special Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on (i) a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 20, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Splunk, Cisco Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and Spirit Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), (ii) a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Splunk’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise related to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Compensation Proposal”), and (iii) a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Splunk and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, with Splunk continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger”).

If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $157.00 in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Splunk common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights.

The Board of Directors of Splunk (the “Board of Directors”), after considering the factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, has unanimously: (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Splunk and Splunk Stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) and consummate the Merger and other transactions described therein upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Splunk, the performance by Splunk of its covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger and other transactions described therein upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) resolved to recommend that Splunk Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the Special Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the Merger. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement.

The proxy statement also describes the actions and determinations of the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. You should carefully read and consider the entire enclosed proxy statement and its annexes, including, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects you.

Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, please sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). If you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by virtual ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy that you have previously submitted.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, without your instructions.

The Merger

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Splunk and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, with Splunk continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Surviving Corporation”). As a result of the Merger, Splunk common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from Nasdaq.

If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. The time at which the Merger will become effective will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the applicable provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) (the time of such filing and the acceptance for record by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Parent, Merger Sub and Splunk and specified in the certificate of merger, the “Effective Time”).

Merger Consideration

Splunk Common Stock

At the Effective Time, each then outstanding share of Splunk common stock (other than shares of Splunk common stock (i) held by Splunk as treasury stock, (ii) owned by Parent, any direct or indirect subsidiary of Splunk, or subsidiary of Parent, or (iii) owned by Splunk Stockholders who have properly demanded and not withdrawn their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Splunk common stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, collectively, the “Excluded Shares”) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $157.00, without interest thereon (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”), less any applicable withholding taxes.

At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) an amount of cash equal to the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration with a designated exchange agent for payment of each share of Splunk common stock owned by each Splunk Stockholder. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures.”

After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a Splunk Stockholder (except that Splunk Stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights may have the right to receive payment for the “fair value” of their shares determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding, as contemplated by Delaware law). For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Dissenters’ Rights.”

Treatment of Company Equity Awards

The Merger Agreement provides that Splunk’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the following treatment as of the Effective Time:

Vested Company Equity Awards

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each (i) option to purchase shares of Splunk common stock (a “Company Option”) that (x) is vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (y) vests effective as of the Effective Time and in accordance with the terms of the applicable contract with Splunk as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Vested Company Option”) that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)restricted stock unit (a “Company RSU”) that (x) is vested but not yet settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any restricted stock unit agreement), (y) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of Splunk (the “Board of Directors”) or (z) vests effective as of the Effective Time and in accordance with its terms (a “Vested Company RSU”), and

[TABLE OF CONTENTS](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000114036123050211/ny20011269x2_defm14a.htm#TOC)

(iii)performance-based restricted stock unit (a “Company PSU”) that (x) is vested but not yet settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (y) vests effective as of the Effective Time based on attainment of the actual level of performance as determined prior to the Closing by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof in accordance solely with the terms of the applicable contract with Splunk as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Vested Company PSU”), will terminate and be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable “Cash-Out Amount” from Parent for such Vested Company Option, Vested Company RSU or Vested Company PSU, less any applicable taxes.

For each Vested Company Option, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock subject to such Vested Company Option by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration less the exercise price per share of such Vested Company Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For each Vested Company RSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock issuable upon settlement of such Vested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration. For each Vested Company PSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock issuable upon settlement of such Vested Company PSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Unvested Company Equity Awards

Unvested Company Shares. At the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Splunk common stock that is restricted, subject to repurchase rights or otherwise not fully vested (an “Unvested Company Share”) will remain subject to the same restrictions, vesting arrangements or repurchase rights that were applicable to such Unvested Company Shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time, and will become payable by Parent on the date that such Unvested Company Share would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time, and will otherwise remain subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company Share immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each outstanding repurchase right will be assigned to Parent in the Merger and will thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and subject to the same conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Company Option that is not a Vested Company Option (an “Unvested Company Option”) that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Company RSU that is not a Vested Company RSU (an “Unvested Company RSU”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable “Cash-Out Amount” from Parent for such Unvested Company Option or Unvested Company RSU (the “Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs)”). Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, the Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) will vest and become payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option or Unvested Company RSU, as applicable, from which such resulting Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and will otherwise remain subject to the same terms, conditions, restrictions and service-based vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company Options or Unvested Company RSUs, as applicable, including those provisions for accelerated vesting on certain terminations of employment, in each case, as in effect from time to time unless otherwise superseded by any applicable contract between the holder thereof and Splunk or Parent or their respective affiliates, but effective from and after the Effective Time.

For each Unvested Company Option, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock subject to such Unvested Company Option by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration less the exercise price per share of such Unvested Company Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

For each Unvested Company RSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock issuable upon settlement of such Unvested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Unvested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Company PSU that is not a Vested Company PSU (an “Unvested Company PSU”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and represent the right to

receive the applicable “Cash-Out Amount” from Parent for such Unvested Company PSU (the “Unvested Cash (PSUs)”). Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, the Unvested Cash (PSUs) will vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company PSU from which such Unvested Cash (PSUs) was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and will otherwise remain subject to the same terms, conditions, restrictions and service-based vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company PSUs, including those provisions for accelerated vesting on certain terminations of employment as in effect from time to time unless otherwise superseded by any applicable contract between the holder thereof and Splunk or Parent or their respective affiliates, but effective from and after the Effective Time.

For each Unvested Company PSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Splunk common stock underlying such Unvested Company PSU (assuming conversion of performance-based vesting to service-based vesting and satisfaction of such service-based vesting schedule and based on the attainment of the applicable performance metrics at the actual level of performance through Closing as determined prior to the Closing by the Board of Directors or committee thereof in accordance solely with the terms applicable to such Unvested Company PSU), by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

For more information on the treatment of Unvested Company Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs (collectively, the “Company Equity Awards”), please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—Treatment of Company Equity Awards.”

Treatment of Company ESPP

In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, on September 20, 2023, the Board of Directors adopted resolutions with respect to the Splunk 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Company ESPP”), providing that (i) with respect to any “Offering Period” (as defined in the Company ESPP) in effect as of September 20, 2023 (the “Current ESPP Offering Period”), no employee who is not a participant in the Company ESPP as of September 20, 2023 may become a participant in the Company ESPP and no participant may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect on September 20, 2023, for such Current ESPP Offering Period, (ii) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP will terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) if all such Current ESPP Offering Periods terminate prior to the Effective Time, then the Company ESPP will be suspended, (iv) no new Offering Period will be commenced under the Company ESPP prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement and (v) if any Current ESPP Offering Period is still in effect at the Effective Time, then the last day of such Current ESPP Offering Period will be accelerated to the Business Day prior to the Closing Date and the final settlement or purchase of shares of Company Common Stock thereunder will be made on that day.

For more information on the treatment of the Company ESPP, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—Treatment of Company ESPP.”

Treatment of Convertible Notes and Capped Calls

The Merger Agreement provides that, on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and Splunk are required, as and to the extent required by the Convertible Notes Indentures (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Financing of the Merger”), to execute any supplemental indentures required by the Convertible Notes Indentures and deliver any certificates and other documents required by the Convertible Notes Indentures. Splunk must provide Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any notices, certificates, press releases, supplemental indentures, or other documents or instruments deliverable pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indentures prior to the dispatch or making thereof.

Prior to the Effective Time, Splunk is required to (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent to enter into arrangements with the counterparties to the Capped Call Transactions (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Capped Call Transactions”) to cause the Capped Call Transactions to be exercised, settled, cancelled or otherwise terminated as of the Closing Date, and to enter into any documentation required to effect such termination, (ii) use reasonable efforts to keep Parent informed of any discussions and negotiations with the counterparties to the Capped Call Transactions with respect to the Capped Call Transactions and give Parent reasonable opportunity to participate (or have its counsel participate) in any such discussions and negotiations, (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, provide Parent with any notices or other written

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The receipt of cash by Splunk Stockholders in exchange for shares of Splunk common stock in the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Splunk common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger.

For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, Splunk Stockholders should read the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

Splunk Stockholders should consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. tax jurisdiction.

Appraisal Rights

Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, dissenting Splunk Stockholders will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Splunk common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. The “fair value” of such shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be greater than, the same as, or less than the Per Share Merger Consideration.

The right to seek appraisal will be lost if a Splunk Stockholder votes FOR the Merger Agreement. However, abstaining or voting against the Merger Agreement is not in itself sufficient to perfect appraisal rights because additional actions must also be taken to perfect such rights. To exercise appraisal rights, Splunk Stockholders who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Splunk common stock must advise Splunk by submitting a written demand for appraisal to Splunk prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, and must otherwise strictly follow the applicable procedures and requirements prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Splunk common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, may perfect appraisal rights in such person’s name if such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the Effective Time and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to Splunk Stockholders of record under Section 262(a) of the DGCL. In addition, the beneficial owner must (1) reasonably identify in his, her or its demand the holder of record of the shares of Splunk common stock for which the demand is made, (2) provide documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (3) provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by Splunk and to be set forth on the verified list of persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares pursuant to Section 262(f) of the DGCL. In addition, under Section 262 of the DGCL, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all Splunk Stockholders who have perfected their appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Splunk common stock or (2) the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the total number of shares of Splunk common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million. In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, Splunk Stockholders that may wish to pursue appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

Following the announcement of the proposed transaction, Splunk received demands on behalf of purported stockholders alleging that the proxy statement filed in connection with the Merger between Splunk and Parent omitted certain purportedly material information regarding Splunk’s financial projections and Qatalyst Partners’ and Morgan Stanley’s financial analyses. Each demand requests corrective disclosures in advance of the Special Meeting. Splunk believes the demands are without merit. It is possible additional demands may be sent or lawsuits may be filed between the date of this proxy statement and consummation of the Merger.

Required Stockholder Approval

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Splunk common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. At the close of business on October 23, 2023 (the “Record Date”), 84,268,367 votes constitute a majority of the outstanding shares of Splunk common stock. Approval of the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Splunk’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Compensation Proposal”) and the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”), whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Splunk common stock present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter and voted for or against the matter. The approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory (non-binding) and is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 273,627 shares of Splunk common stock, representing approximately 0.2% of the shares of Splunk common stock outstanding as of the Record Date (and approximately 0.2% of the shares of Splunk common stock outstanding when taking into account Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers).

On September 20, 2023, in connection with the Merger Agreement, Parent also entered into a Voting and Support Agreement (the “Voting and Support Agreement”) with certain funds affiliated with Hellman & Friedman Advisors LLC (collectively, “H&F”) and Splunk. As of the Record Date, H&F owns 12,799,822 shares of Splunk common stock, representing approximately 7.6% of the shares of Splunk common stock outstanding as of the Record Date. The Voting and Support Agreement provides H&F with certain registration rights pursuant to which, among other things, the Company has agreed to prepare and file a registration statement with the SEC as soon as practicable for purposes of registering the resale of any Registrable Securities (as defined in the Voting and Support Agreement). A copy of the Voting and Support Agreement is attached as Annex B and is incorporated herein by reference.

Pursuant to the Voting and Support Agreement, H&F has agreed, among other things, to (i) vote in favor of the proposal to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and (ii) vote against (x) any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions of Splunk’s obligations set forth in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” not being fulfilled and (y) any Acquisition Proposal, or any agreement, transaction or other matter that is intended to, or would reasonably be expected to, prevent, materially impede or interfere with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

We currently expect that our directors and executive officers will vote all of their respective shares of Splunk common stock: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors

The Board of Directors has unanimously: (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Splunk and Splunk Stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Splunk, the performance by Splunk of its covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) resolved to recommend that Splunk Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Splunk Stockholders, under certain circumstances, the Board of Directors may withdraw or change the foregoing recommendation if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties to Splunk Stockholders under applicable law. However, the Board of Directors cannot withdraw or change the foregoing recommendation unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, negotiating with Parent and its representatives in good faith over a four-(4)-business-day period, after which the Board of Directors shall have determined that the failure of the Board of Directors to make a Change of Recommendation (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”) would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties to Splunk Stockholders under applicable law. The termination of the Merger Agreement by Splunk following the Board of Directors’ authorization for Splunk to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers”) will result in the payment by Splunk of a termination fee of $1,000,000,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation.”

Acquisition Proposals

No Solicitation of Other Offers

From the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier of the date the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Effective Time, Splunk may not, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, support, facilitate or induce the making, submission or public announcement of any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into, participate in, maintain or continue discussions or negotiations with, or provide any non-public information to, any person relating to, an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) agree to, accept, approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; (iv) enter into any agreement or contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal, other than a confidentiality agreement; (v) approve any transaction or any third-party becoming an “interested stockholder” under the DGCL; or (vi) submit any such transaction to the vote of Splunk Stockholders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the time that Splunk Stockholders approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement, Splunk or any of its representatives receives an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers”) and the Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Splunk Stockholders under applicable laws, Splunk may (i) enter into discussions with such person regarding such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) deliver or make available to such person non-public information regarding Splunk and its subsidiaries. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers.”

The termination of the Merger Agreement by Splunk following the Board of Directors’ authorization for Splunk to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction contemplated by a Superior Proposal will result in the payment by Splunk to Parent of a termination fee of $1,000,000,000.

Q:Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?

A:Stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting. Each holder of Splunk common stock shall be entitled to cast one (1) vote on each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting for each such share owned at the close of business on the Record Date.

Q:May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?

A:Yes. If you are a Splunk Stockholder of record, you may attend the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SPLK2023SM on November 29, 2023, at 2:00 p.m., Pacific time, and complete a virtual ballot, whether or not you sign and return your proxy card. If you are a Splunk Stockholder of record, you will need your assigned 16-digit control number to vote shares electronically at the Special Meeting. The control number can be found on the proxy card, voting instruction form, or other applicable proxy notices.

If you attend the Special Meeting and complete a virtual ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Q:What will I receive in respect of my shares of Splunk common stock if the Merger is completed?

A:Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration of $157.00 in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Splunk common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal rights under the DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of Splunk common stock, you will receive $15,700 in cash in exchange for your shares of Splunk common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.

Q:What will the holders of outstanding Company Equity Awards receive if the Merger is completed?

A:Upon completion of the Merger:

Vested Company Options, Vested Company RSUs and Vested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time, and by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Vested Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU that is outstanding and has not yet been settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Vested Company PSU that is outstanding and has not yet been settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will terminate and be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable Cash-Out Amount from Parent for such Vested Company Option, Vested Company RSU or Vested Company PSU, less any applicable taxes.

For each Vested Company Option, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock subject to such Vested Company Option by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration less the exercise price per share of such Vested Company Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

For each Vested Company RSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock issuable upon settlement of such Vested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

For each Vested Company PSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock issuable upon settlement of such Vested Company PSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Unvested Company Shares. At the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each Unvested Company Share will remain subject to the same restrictions, vesting arrangements or repurchase rights that were applicable to such Unvested Company Shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time, and will become payable by Parent on the date that such unvested Company share would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time, and will otherwise remain subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying unvested Company share immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each outstanding repurchase right shall be assigned to Parent in the Merger and will thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and subject to the same conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Unvested Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Unvested Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable Cash-Out Amount from Parent for such Unvested Company Option or Unvested Company RSU (such amount, the “Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs)”). Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, the Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) will vest and become payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option or Unvested Company RSU, as applicable, from which such resulting Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and will otherwise remain subject to the same terms, conditions, restrictions and service-based vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company Options or Unvested Company RSUs, as applicable, including those provisions for accelerated vesting on certain terminations of employment, in each case, as in effect from time to time unless otherwise superseded by any applicable contract between the holder thereof and Splunk or Parent or their respective affiliates, but effective from and after the Effective Time.

For each Unvested Company Option, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock subject to such Unvested Company Option by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration less the exercise price per share of such Unvested Company Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

For each Unvested Company RSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock issuable upon settlement of such Unvested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Unvested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Unvested Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable Cash-Out Amount from Parent for such Unvested Company PSU (the “Unvested Cash (PSUs)”). Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, the Unvested Cash (PSUs) will vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company PSU from which such Unvested Cash (PSUs) was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and will otherwise remain subject to the same terms, conditions, restrictions and service-based vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company PSUs, including those provisions for accelerated vesting on certain terminations of employment, as in effect from time to time unless otherwise superseded by any applicable contract between the holder thereof and Splunk or Parent or their respective affiliates, but effective from and after the Effective Time.

For each Unvested Company PSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Splunk common stock underlying such Unvested Company PSU (assuming conversion of performance-based vesting to service-based vesting and satisfaction of such service-based vesting and based on the attainment of the applicable performance metrics at the actual level of performance through Closing as determined prior to the Closing by the Board of Directors or committee thereof in accordance solely with the terms applicable to such Unvested Company PSU), by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

For more information on the treatment of Company Equity Awards, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—Treatment of Company Equity Awards.”

Q:What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?

A:The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Splunk common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement.

If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any Splunk Stockholder of record to: (i) submit a signed proxy card; (ii) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card); or (iii) vote in person by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2)“FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

Q:I understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a quorum?

A:The holders of a majority of the voting power, representing 84,268,367 shares of Splunk common stock, entitled

[TABLE OF CONTENTS](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000114036123050211/ny20011269x2_defm14a.htm#TOC)

to vote at the Special Meeting as of the record date must be present at the Special Meeting in order to hold the Special Meeting and conduct business. This presence is called a quorum. Your shares are counted as present at the Special Meeting if you are present and vote in person at the Special Meeting or if you have properly submitted a proxy.

Q:Have any Splunk Stockholders already agreed to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement?

A:Yes. On September 20, 2023, in connection with the Merger Agreement, Parent also entered into a Voting and Support Agreement with H&F and Splunk. As of the Record Date, H&F owns 12,799,822 shares of Splunk common stock, representing approximately 7.6% of the shares of Splunk common stock outstanding as of the Record Date. A copy of the Voting and Support Agreement is attached as Annex B and is incorporated herein by reference. Pursuant to the Voting and Support Agreement, H&F has agreed, among other things, to vote their shares of Splunk common stock in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and against any competing transaction so long as the Merger Agreement remains in effect. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Voting and Support Agreement.” In addition to H&F, all of Splunk’s executive officers and directors, who together hold 273,627 shares of Splunk common stock, are expected to be present and vote all of their shares in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Q:What happens if the Merger is not completed?

A:If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Splunk Stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, Splunk Stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Splunk common stock. Instead, Splunk will remain an independent public company, Splunk common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.

Under certain specified circumstances, Splunk is required to pay Parent a termination fee equal to $1,000,000,000, and under other specified circumstances, Parent is required to pay Splunk a termination fee equal to $1,478,000,000, in each case, in connection with, and upon, the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Termination Fees.”

Q:Why are Splunk Stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation Proposal?

A:The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require Splunk to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Q:What vote is required to approve the Compensation Proposal?

A:The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter and voted for or against the matter is required for approval of the Compensation Proposal.

Q:What will happen if Splunk Stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?

A:Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Splunk. Therefore, if the other requisite Splunk Stockholder approvals are obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to Splunk’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements.

Q:What do I need to do now?

A:You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects

you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card), so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek appraisal. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.

Q:Am I entitled to dissenters’ rights?

A:Yes, in certain circumstances. If the Merger is completed, dissenting Splunk Stockholders will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of Splunk common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of Splunk common stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Splunk common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest on the amount determined to be the fair value, if any, as determined by the court (or, in certain circumstances described below, on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid to each Splunk Stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding). Holders of shares of Splunk common stock who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this Proxy Statement, and Section 262 of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. Failure to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Merger Agreement—Dissenters’ Rights.”

Q:How do I exercise and perfect my dissenters’ rights?

A:If you are a Splunk Stockholder of record or a beneficial holder and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares of Splunk common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:

•You must deliver to Splunk a written demand for appraisal before the vote on approval of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the Merger Agreement. Voting against or failing to vote for the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the Splunk Stockholder of record or beneficial holder and the intention of such holder to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares of Splunk common stock. A failure by such holder to make a written demand for appraisal before the vote with respect to the Merger Agreement is taken will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

•In the case of a Splunk Stockholder of record, you must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the Merger Agreement. A vote in favor of the Merger Agreement, by proxy submitted by mail, over the Internet or by telephone, will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares of Splunk common stock so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A proxy which does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Agreement. Therefore, a Splunk Stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must instruct the proxy to vote against the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the Merger Agreement. In the case of a beneficial owner, you must not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your share(s) of Splunk common stock, or abstain from voting, in favor of the Merger Agreement;

•You must continuously hold or beneficially own, as applicable, shares of Splunk common stock from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer the shares before the Effective Time; and

•You must otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, including the requirement that you, another Splunk Stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 or Splunk must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. Splunk is under no obligation to file any petition and has no present intention of doing so.

[TABLE OF CONTENTS](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000114036123050211/ny20011269x2_defm14a.htm#TOC)

If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Splunk common stock.

In addition, because shares of Splunk common stock are listed on a national securities exchange and is expected to continue to be listed on such exchange immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all shares of Splunk common stock, unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Splunk common stock eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration for such total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million (collectively, the “Ownership Thresholds”). At least one of the Ownership Thresholds must be met in order for Splunk Stockholders to be entitled to seek appraisal with respect to such shares of Splunk common stock.

In the case of a record holder of shares of Splunk common stock, voting, via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the Merger Agreement will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal is in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote. If you want to exercise your appraisal rights, you must not vote your shares of Splunk common stock via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy in favor of the Merger Agreement.

In the case of a beneficial owner of shares of Splunk common stock, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares in “street name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote those shares on the Merger Agreement without specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner on such proposal, but such brokers, banks or other nominees will vote such shares as instructed if the beneficial owner provides such instructions. If a beneficial owner of shares of Splunk common stock held in “street name” instructs such person’s broker, bank or other nominee to vote such person’s shares in favor of the Merger Agreement, and does not revoke such instruction prior to the vote on the Merger Agreement, then such shares will be voted in favor of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of such beneficial owner’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, if you are a beneficial owner of shares of Splunk common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, you must either not provide any instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the Merger Agreement or instruct such broker, bank or other nominee to vote against the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on such proposal.

Q:Should I surrender my book-entry shares now?

A:No. After the Merger is completed, your shares of Splunk common stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive your portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration. Exchange of book-entry shares representing shares of Splunk common stock will be effected in accordance with the exchange agent’s customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.

Q:What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Splunk common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?

A:The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of Splunk common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Splunk in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Splunk common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card).

Q:What is the difference between holding shares as a Splunk Stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?

A:If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Equiniti Trust Company, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “Splunk Stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Splunk.

If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of Splunk common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the Splunk Stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the Splunk Stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Q:How may I vote?

A:If you are a Splunk Stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of Splunk common stock are registered in your name with Equiniti Trust Company, our transfer agent), there are four (4) ways to vote:

•by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;

•by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;

•by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or

•by attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing a virtual ballot.

A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of Splunk common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the Internet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy card, in each case, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.

Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of Splunk common stock by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of Splunk common stock in person by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote in person by virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.

Q:If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?

A:No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted against adoption of the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

Q:May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?

A:Yes. If you are a Splunk Stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by:

•signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;

•submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;

•delivering a written notice of revocation to the Secretary of Splunk prior to the Special Meeting; or

•by attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing a virtual ballot.

If you hold your shares of Splunk common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Q:What is a proxy?

A:A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of Splunk common stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Splunk common stock is called a “proxy card.” Gary Steele, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Roberts, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Scott Morgan, our Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, are the proxy holders for the Special Meeting, with full power of substitution and re-substitution.

Q:If a Splunk Stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?

A:Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.

If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

Q:What should I do if I receive more than one (1) set of voting materials?

A:Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card) each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive.

You may receive more than one (1) set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one (1) brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a Splunk Stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one (1) name, you will receive more than one (1) proxy card.

Q:Who will count the votes?

A:The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present.

Q:Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?

A:Splunk intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports that Splunk files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Q:Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Splunk common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?

A:The exchange of Splunk common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) who exchanges shares of Splunk common stock for cash in the Merger will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.

For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

You should consult your tax advisor(s) concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of your particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. tax jurisdiction.

Q:When do you expect the Merger to be completed?

A:We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger by the end of the third calendar quarter of 2024. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted, because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, many of which are outside of our control.

Q:Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?

A:The expenses of soliciting proxies will be paid by Splunk. Splunk has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in soliciting proxies at a fee of $50,000, plus costs and expenses. Splunk and its agents may solicit proxies by mail, electronic mail, telephone, facsimile, by other similar means, or in person. Our directors, officers, and other employees, without additional compensation, and employees of Innisfree M&A Incorporated may solicit proxies personally or in writing, by telephone, email, or otherwise. Splunk will request brokers, custodians, nominees and other record holders to forward copies of the soliciting materials to persons for whom they hold shares and to request authority for the exercise of proxies. In such cases, Splunk, upon the request of the record holders, will reimburse such holders for their reasonable expenses. If you choose to access the proxy materials through the internet, you are responsible for any internet access charges you may incur.

Q:What if during the check-in time or during the meeting I have technical difficulties or trouble accessing the virtual meeting website?

A:Splunk will have technicians ready to assist you with any technical difficulties you may have accessing the virtual meeting website. If you encounter any difficulties accessing the Special Meeting during the check-in time or during the Special Meeting, please call the technical support number that will be posted on the Special Meeting log-in page at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SPLK2023SM.

Q:Do any of Splunk’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ from those of Splunk Stockholders generally?

A:Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that Splunk’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger different from, or in addition to, the interests of Splunk Stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Splunk Stockholders. For a description of the interests of Splunk’s directors and executive officers in the Merger, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger.”

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement, and any document to which Splunk refers in this proxy statement, contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are based on Splunk’s current expectations, estimates and projections about the expected date of closing of the proposed transaction and the potential benefits thereof, its business and industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by Splunk and Parent, all of which are subject to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “could,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “may,” “would,” “might,” “potentially,” “estimate,” “continue,” “expect,” “target,” similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of future results, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements, including the failure to consummate the proposed transaction or to make or take any filing or other action required to consummate the transaction on a timely matter or at all, are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to:

(i)the completion of the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining shareholder and regulatory approvals, anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Splunk’s business and other conditions to the completion of the transaction;

(ii)the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Splunk’s business and general economic conditions;

(iii)Splunk’s ability to implement its business strategy;

(iv)significant transaction costs associated with the proposed transaction;

(v)potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction;

(vi)the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm Splunk’s business, including current plans and operations;

(vii)the ability of Splunk to retain and hire key personnel;

(viii)potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed transaction;

(ix)legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting Splunk’s business;

(x)general economic and market developments and conditions;

(xi)the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which Splunk operates;

(xii)potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the merger that could affect Splunk’s financial performance;

(xiii)restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact Splunk’s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions;

(xiv)unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as Splunk’s response to any of the aforementioned factors; and

(xv)such other risks and uncertainties described more fully in documents filed with or furnished to the SEC by Splunk, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K previously filed with the SEC on March 23, 2023 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

While the list of factors presented here is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Splunk’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Splunk expressly qualifies in their entirety all forward-looking statements attributable to either Splunk or any person acting on Splunk’s behalf by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this proxy statement. All information provided in this proxy statement is as of the date hereof and Splunk undertakes no duty to update this information except as required by law. Splunk does not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.

THE SPECIAL MEETING

The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors for use at the Special Meeting.

Date, Time and Place

The Special Meeting will be held on November 29, 2023, at 2:00 p.m., Pacific time. Splunk will hold the special meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/SPLK2023SM. You will not be able to attend the Special Meeting physically in person.

[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000114036123050211/ny20011269x2_defm14a.htm)
Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the Special Meeting, we will ask Splunk Stockholders to vote on proposals to: (i) adopt the Merger Agreement; (ii) approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (iii) adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000114036123050211/ny20011269x2_defm14a.htm)
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum

Only Splunk Stockholders of record as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting. A list of Splunk Stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at the virtual meeting website during the Special Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 168,536,732 shares of Splunk common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.

The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote in person or as represented by proxy will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.

[](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000114036123050211/ny20011269x2_defm14a.htm)
Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Splunk common stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. As of the Record Date, 84,268,367 votes constitute a majority of the outstanding shares of Splunk common stock. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by Splunk Stockholders is a condition to the closing of the Merger.

The affirmative vote by holders of a majority of the votes cast at the Special Meeting is required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal.

Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast at the Special Meeting.

If a Splunk Stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if Splunk Stockholders voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. A so-called “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. Splunk does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is considered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of Splunk common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Stock Ownership and Interests of Certain Persons

Shares Held by Splunk’s Directors and Executive Officers

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 273,627 shares of Splunk common stock, representing approximately 0.2% of the shares of Splunk common stock outstanding on the Record Date (and approximately 0.2% of the total shares of Splunk common stock outstanding when taking into account Company Options held, in the aggregate, by our directors and executive officers).

Voting of Proxies

If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Equiniti Trust Company, you may cause your shares to be voted by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid envelope, or you may vote in person at the Special Meeting. Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (using the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card). You must have the enclosed proxy card available and follow the instructions on the proxy card in order to grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone. Based on your proxy cards or Internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will vote your shares according to your directions.

If you plan to attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a virtual ballot at the Special Meeting. If your shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person. If you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by virtual ballot, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.

Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the Splunk Stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted:(1)“FOR” adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or attending the Special Meeting and voting in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee. If such a service is provided, you may vote over the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if possible, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but will not have any effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

Revocability of Proxies

If you are a Splunk Stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by:

•signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;

•submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;

•delivering a written notice of revocation to the Secretary of Splunk prior to the Special Meeting; or

•attending the Special Meeting virtually via the Internet at the virtual meeting website and completing a virtual ballot.

If you have submitted a proxy, your appearance at the Special Meeting will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy;

provided
that you do not vote in person or submit an additional proxy or revocation, which, in each case, will have the effect of revoking your proxy.

If you hold your shares of Splunk common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Any adjournment, postponement or other delay of the Special Meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, will allow Splunk Stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Special Meeting as adjourned, postponed or delayed.

Board of Directors’ Recommendation

The Board of Directors has unanimously: (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Splunk and Splunk Stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Splunk, the performance by Splunk of its covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) resolved to recommend that Splunk Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

Solicitation of Proxies

The expenses of soliciting proxies will be paid by Splunk. Splunk has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in soliciting proxies at a fee of $50,000, plus costs and expenses. Splunk and its agents may solicit proxies by mail, electronic mail, telephone, facsimile, by other similar means, or in person. Our directors, officers, and other employees, without additional compensation, and employees of Innisfree M&A Incorporated may solicit proxies personally or in writing, by telephone, email, or otherwise. Splunk will request brokers, custodians, nominees and other record holders to forward copies of the soliciting materials to persons for whom they hold shares and to request authority for the exercise of proxies. In such cases, Splunk, upon the request of the record holders, will reimburse such holders for their reasonable expenses. If you choose to access the proxy materials through the internet, you are responsible for any internet access charges you may incur.

Anticipated Date of Completion of the Merger

Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by Splunk Stockholders of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, we anticipate that the Merger will be consummated by the end of the third calendar quarter of 2024.

Dissenters’ Rights

If the Merger is consummated, Splunk Stockholders who continuously hold shares of Splunk common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Splunk Stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, who do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal, and who follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Splunk common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be “fair value,” if any, (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Dissenters’ Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the “fair value” and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each Splunk Stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, Splunk Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to Splunk before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold your shares of Splunk common stock of record through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Merger unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by Splunk Stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Dissenters’ Rights,” which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced and attached as Annex D to this proxy statement and incorporated herein by reference. If you hold your shares of Splunk common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such bank, brokerage firm or nominee.

Delisting and Deregistration of Splunk Common Stock

If the Merger is completed, the shares of Splunk common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and shares of Splunk common stock will no longer be publicly traded.

Derivative Claims

As disclosed in footnote 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Splunk’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending July 31, 2023, ten derivative lawsuits were filed on behalf of Splunk in February, March and April 2021, October and December 2022, and January, February and March 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the California Superior Court, San Francisco County, and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Due to the consolidation of several of these lawsuits and the voluntary dismissal of one of the lawsuits, there are now six pending derivative actions naming Splunk’s former Chief Executive Officer, Splunk’s former Chief Financial Officer, several other current and former officers, and many of Splunk’s current and former board members as defendants, and Splunk as a nominal defendant. The derivative actions allege claims for breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, abuse of control, and gross mismanagement against the defendants, and claims for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act against only Splunk’s former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer. The plaintiffs in these derivative lawsuits seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief on behalf of Splunk. The courts have stayed three of the six derivative actions pursuant to stipulation of the parties, and the parties have submitted a stipulation and proposed order staying one other derivative action. Under applicable laws, if and when the Merger is consummated, Splunk believes that the foregoing stockholder plaintiffs should lose their standing to pursue to the foregoing derivative claims on behalf of Splunk.

Merger Consideration

Splunk Common Stock

At the Effective Time, each share of Splunk common stock (other than Excluded Shares, which include, for example, shares of Splunk common stock owned by Splunk Stockholders who have properly exercised and not withdrawn their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards

The Merger Agreement provides that Company Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the following treatment:

Vested Company Equity Awards

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Vested Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU that is outstanding and has not yet been settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Vested Company PSU that is outstanding and has not yet been settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will terminate and be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable “Cash-Out Amount” from Parent for such Vested Company Option, Vested Company RSU or Vested Company PSU, less any applicable taxes.

For each Vested Company Option, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock subject to such Vested Company Option by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration less the exercise price per share of such Vested Company Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

For each Vested Company RSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock issuable upon settlement of such Vested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

For each Vested Company PSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock issuable upon settlement of such Vested Company PSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Unvested Company Equity Awards

Unvested Company Shares. At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Share will remain subject to the same restrictions, vesting arrangements or repurchase rights that were applicable to such Unvested Company Shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time, and will become payable by Parent on the date that such Unvested Company Share would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time, and will otherwise remain subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company Share immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each outstanding repurchase right will be assigned to Parent in the Merger and will thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and subject to the same conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Unvested Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Unvested Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable “Cash-Out Amount” from Parent for such Unvested Company Option or Unvested Company RSU (the “Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs)”). Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, the Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) will vest and become payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option or Unvested Company RSU, as applicable, from which such resulting Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and will otherwise remain subject to the same terms, conditions, restrictions and service-based vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company Options or Unvested Company RSUs, as applicable, including those provisions for accelerated vesting on certain terminations of employment, in each case, as in effect from time to time unless otherwise superseded by any applicable contract between the holder thereof and Splunk or Parent or their respective affiliates, but effective from and after the Effective Time.

For each Unvested Company Option, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock subject to such Unvested Company Option by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration less the exercise price per share of such Unvested Company Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

For each Unvested Company RSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock issuable upon settlement of such Unvested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Unvested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Unvested Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable “Cash-Out Amount” from Parent for such Unvested Company PSU (the “Unvested Cash (PSUs)”). Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, the Unvested Cash (PSUs) will vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company PSU from which such Unvested Cash (PSUs) was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and will otherwise remain subject to the same terms, conditions, restrictions and service-based vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company PSUs, including those provisions for accelerated vesting on certain terminations of employment, as in effect from time to time unless otherwise superseded by any applicable contract between the holder thereof and Splunk or Parent or their respective affiliates, but effective from and after the Effective Time.

For each Unvested Company PSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Splunk common stock underlying such Unvested Company PSU (assuming conversion of performance-based vesting to service-based vesting and satisfaction of such service-based vesting and based on the attainment of the applicable performance metrics at the actual level of performance through Closing as determined prior to the Closing by the Board of Directors or committee thereof in accordance solely with the terms applicable to such Unvested Company PSU), by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Treatment of Company ESPP

In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, on September 20, 2023, the Board of Directors adopted resolutions with respect to the Company ESPP, providing that (i) with respect to any Current ESPP Offering Period, no employee who is not a participant in the Company ESPP as of September 20, 2023 may become a participant in the Company ESPP and no participant may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect on September 20, 2023, for such Current ESPP Offering Period, (ii) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP will terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) if all such Current ESPP Offering Periods terminate prior to the Effective Time, then the Company ESPP will be suspended, (iv)no new Offering Period will be commenced under the Company ESPP prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement and (v) if any Current ESPP Offering Period is still in effect at the Effective Time, then the last day of such Current ESPP Offering Period will be accelerated to the Business Day prior to the Closing Date and the final settlement or purchase of shares of Company Common Stock thereunder will be made on that day.

Background of the Merger

The Board of Directors and Splunk’s senior management team regularly review Splunk’s business, financial performance and strategic direction, outlook and growth prospects in light of industry and market developments. As part of this assessment, the Board of Directors and Splunk’s senior management regularly consider potential opportunities to strengthen Splunk’s business and enhance stockholder value, including by pursuing strategic opportunities such as acquisitions, dispositions, commercial partnerships or combinations with third parties. Consistent with their fiduciary duty to enhance stockholder value, the Board of Directors and management have always remained open to considering third-party interest in strategic transactions with Splunk as well.

On November 15, 2021, Doug Merritt, Splunk’s Chief Executive Officer, stepped down and Graham Smith, Chair of the Board of Directors, was appointed Interim Chief Executive Officer. Following this announcement, Splunk’s stock price declined from $167.82 per share on November 12, 2021, to $137.38 on November 15, 2021. Following such date and over the course of the ensuing several months, Splunk began its search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer.

On November 19, 2021, Chuck Robbins, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Cisco, contacted Mr. Smith regarding Cisco’s potential interest in exploring a strategic combination with Splunk and inquired whether it would be possible to discuss the topic with Mr. Smith. On December 15, 2021, Mr. Smith spoke with Mr. Robbins and Mr. Robbins reiterated Cisco’s interest in a potential transaction involving Splunk. No terms, including price, with respect to any potential transaction were discussed.

On December 17, 2021, Splunk received an unsolicited non-binding indication of interest from Cisco to acquire Splunk for $165 to $175 per share in cash. Cisco’s indication of interest was subject to a number of conditions, including completion of its due diligence review of Splunk and finalization of definitive agreements for the proposed transaction. On December 21, 2021, Cisco supplemented its December 17th proposal with a letter to Splunk requesting access to certain key non-public diligence information regarding Splunk in order to allow Cisco to continue to evaluate its offer.

Over the ensuing several weeks, at Cisco’s request, representatives of Cisco and Splunk discussed publicly available information relating to Splunk’s business, operations and outlook. During this period of time, Splunk was also continuing its search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer and began to consider and work with Gary Steele as a candidate for this role.

On January 14, 2022, Splunk received a revised non-binding indication of interest from Cisco to acquire Splunk for $175 to $190 per share in cash, again subject to a number of conditions including completion of Cisco’s due diligence review of Splunk and finalization of definitive agreements for the proposed transaction.

On January 23, 2022, Cisco and Splunk entered into a customary confidentiality agreement (the “Confidentiality Agreement”) in order to facilitate their discussions and information sharing. The Confidentiality Agreement included a customary “standstill” provision but did not include a so-called “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision. Over the next several weeks, representatives of Cisco and Splunk continued to discuss Splunk’s business, operations and outlook. Also, in January 2022, the Board of Directors engaged Qatalyst Partners and another financial advisor to, among other things, assist Splunk in evaluating strategic alternatives for Splunk, including a possible sale of Splunk. Qatalyst Partners was selected by the Board of Directors based on its qualifications, expertise, reputation, and its knowledge of Splunk’s business and the industry in which it operates, to act as Splunk’s financial advisor.

On February 4, 2022, Splunk received a revised non-binding indication of interest from Cisco to acquire Splunk for $193 per share in cash, again subject to a number of conditions including completion of Cisco’s due diligence review of Splunk and finalization of definitive agreements for the proposed transaction.

On February 6, 2022, Mr. Smith spoke with Mr. Robbins by telephone and Mr. Smith verbally conveyed a counterproposal of $212 per share in cash.

Later that day, Cisco withdrew its indication of interest citing several key factors that would prevent Cisco from being able to move forward with a proposed transaction at the time, including the potential challenges of further exploring a transaction while Splunk was simultaneously finalizing its search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer and making other significant senior management changes.

Following such withdrawal, Splunk and Cisco ceased all transaction-related communications and information sharing and, on February 9, 2022, Splunk sent Cisco a request for return or destruction of confidential information received by Cisco pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement. On February 24, 2022, representatives of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (“Simpson”), outside counsel to Cisco, certified the completion of such return and destruction on behalf of Cisco pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement.

On February 11, 2022, various news outlets in the U.S. reported that Cisco and Splunk had been discussing a potential business combination transaction valuing Splunk at over $20 billion. Neither Cisco nor Splunk commented publicly on these news reports.

Throughout the remainder of 2022 and early 2023, Splunk announced several significant management changes. In March 2022, Splunk announced that Mr.Steele would join the company as its new President and Chief Executive Officer and that its President and Chief Growth Officer was resigning. In May 2022, Splunk announced that its President, Products and Technology, was resigning. In September 2022, Splunk announced that Tom Casey would join the company as its new Senior Vice President and General Manager, Platform and that its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer was resigning. In October 2022, Splunk announced that Sharyl Givens would join the company as its new Chief People Officer. In November 2022, Splunk announced that it had completed its acquisition of TwinWave Security, a private cybersecurity company, and had appointed Mike Horn, TwinWave’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, as Splunk’s new Senior Vice President and General Manager of Security. In January 2023, Splunk announced that Brian Roberts would join the company as its new Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, throughout 2022 and early 2023, Splunk also implemented a number of other personnel and organizational changes to improve efficiency and simplify and flatten Splunk’s management structure and organization.

In addition to management changes, Splunk lowered its outlook in 2022. On August 24, 2022, Splunk announced its second quarter of its fiscal year 2023 results adjusting down guidance for Splunk’s total annual recurring revenue from $3.9 billion to $3.65 billion and cloud annual recurring revenue from $2 billion to $1.8 billion.

Between December 17, 2021 (the date that Splunk received its first unsolicited indication of interest from Cisco) and April 4, 2023, the Nasdaq declined by 19%, the S&P Services and Software index declined by 25% and Splunk’s stock price declined by 15%.

On April 4, 2023, Scott Herren, Cisco’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, contacted Mr.Steele to arrange a telephone call. On the call, Mr.Herren indicated that Cisco was impressed with the composition and performance of Splunk’s new management team and the business progress that Splunk had made since the parties ended transaction discussions in February 2022. Mr.Herren further indicated that Cisco was interested in reengaging with Splunk to explore a potential acquisition of the company if Splunk was open to such discussions. Mr.Steele indicated that he would discuss the matter with Splunk’s Board of Directors and let Mr.Herren know if the Board of Directors was willing to re-engage in potential transaction discussions. Following his call with Mr.Herren, Mr.Steele informed Mr. Smith, Chair of the Board of Directors of Splunk, of his call with Mr.Herren and also consulted with Morgan Stanley, Splunk’s long-standing financial advisor, on among other things, deal negotiations, business diligence matters, and potential next steps and responses to Mr. Herren.

On April 9, 2023, Messrs. Smith and Steele informed the rest of the Board of Directors about Cisco’s renewed interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Splunk and, on April 10, 2023, the Board of Directors convened a meeting to discuss the matter. Members of Splunk’s senior management team and a representative of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (“Skadden”), outside counsel to Splunk, also attended the meeting. At the meeting, Mr.Steele described his recent conversation with Mr.Herren. A representative of Skadden then provided an overview of the directors’ fiduciary duties in connection with their evaluation of a potential sale of Splunk in general and Cisco’s interest in particular. The representative of Skadden emphasized the importance of the Board of Directors’ active involvement and oversight of any engagement with Cisco and other potential buyers, if any. Following a discussion of Splunk’s business outlook and key strategic initiatives, conditions in Splunk’s key businesses, the macro-economic environment in general, and the state of the capital markets, as well as Splunk’s prior engagement with Cisco the previous year, the Board of Directors authorized and instructed Splunk’s management team to engage with Cisco in order to determine whether there was a path to a transaction that would be in the best interests of Splunk Stockholders. Given the extent of the information that Splunk had previously shared with Cisco during the companies’ prior transaction discussions, the Board of Directors also authorized and instructed the management team to update Splunk’s long-term financial forecasts and share a similar level of confidential information with Cisco to ensure that any renewed discussions regarding a potential transaction would be informed by information that reflected Splunk’s then-current business, products, technology and financial outlook.

On April 11, 2023, Mr.Steele called Mr.Herren to inform him that the Splunk Board of Directors had authorized and instructed Mr.Steele and his management team to engage in preliminary discussions with Cisco regarding a potential transaction and, in furtherance thereof, to provide Cisco with confidential information on its business and operations in order to determine whether a potential transaction was in the best interests of Splunk Stockholders. Mr.Herren expressed Cisco’s appreciation and, on April 12, 2023, Mr.Herren sent Mr.Steele a list of preliminary information requests, including a request to meet certain members of Splunk’s senior management team. During the ensuing weeks, the parties discussed logistics for their preliminary meetings and Splunk assembled information in response to Cisco’s information requests.

On April 26, 2023, Cisco and Splunk entered into an amendment to the Confidentiality Agreement to extend the term thereof in order to facilitate their discussions and information sharing.

On April 27, 2023, representatives of Splunk and Cisco held an initial information sharing meeting to discuss Splunk’s business, operations and outlook.

On May 2, 2023, the Board of Directors convened a meeting to discuss the status of Splunk’s engagement with Cisco. Members of Splunk’s management team and a representative of Skadden also attended the meeting. Mr.Steele updated the Board of Directors on Splunk’s recent engagement with Cisco, including Cisco’s request for Splunk’s current financial forecasts. Messrs. Steele and Roberts noted that, consistent with the Board of Directors’ previous authorization and in anticipation of Cisco’s request for current financial forecasts, Splunk’s management team had prepared preliminary financial forecasts for Splunk’s 2024, 2025 and 2026 fiscal years (the “Interim Management Projections”). Mr.Roberts presented the Interim Management Projections and described the methodology and the

material assumptions the management team used to create the Interim Management Projections. The Board of Directors discussed the Interim Management Projections and authorized and instructed the management team to share them with Cisco. The Board of Directors then discussed the status of Splunk’s engagement with Cisco and remained supportive of continued discussions with Cisco in order to determine if Cisco would present Splunk with a compelling transaction proposal.

Between May 3, 2023 and June 19, 2023, representatives of Splunk and Cisco held several additional information sharing meetings to advance discussions on Splunk’s business, technology, operations and outlook. During these meetings, Splunk’s management team shared the Interim Management Projections with representatives of Cisco.

On June 19, 2023, Mr.Steele and Mr. Robbins met in person. During the meeting, Mr. Robbins expressed appreciation for Splunk’s recent business performance and the efforts of Splunk’s new management team. Mr.Robbins also indicated that Cisco would be sending Splunk a non-binding indication of interest to acquire Splunk for $130 per share in cash. Mr.Steele expressed his appreciation for Cisco’s interest and Mr.Robbins’ proposal and indicated that he would discuss the matter with the Board of Directors once Splunk had received Cisco’s written proposal.

On June 20, 2023, Splunk received a non-binding indication of interest from Cisco to acquire Splunk for $130 per share in cash, representing a premium of 20% to Splunk’s closing stock price of $108.02 on June 16, 2023.

On June 21, 2023, the Board of Directors convened a meeting to discuss the status of Splunk’s engagement with Cisco. Members of Splunk’s management team and representatives of Skadden also attended the meeting. Mr.Steele noted that Splunk had received a non-binding indication of interest from Cisco in which Cisco proposed to acquire Splunk for $130 per share in cash, a copy of which had been made available to the Board of Directors. Mr.Steele described the information sharing meetings that the Splunk management team had recently held with Cisco prior to receiving Cisco’s indication of interest and the information shared with Cisco, including the Interim Management Projections. The members of the Board of Directors discussed their initial reactions to Cisco’s proposal, which generally reflected the view that Cisco’s offer price was less attractive than Splunk’s standalone business plans and long-term value prospects. Given Splunk’s previous discussions with Cisco in 2021 and 2022, however, the Board of Directors concluded that Splunk should continue to engage with Cisco to determine whether Cisco could be encouraged to present a more compelling offer.

Due to the fact that Splunk had received an actual transaction proposal from Cisco at this time, the Board of Directors also discussed whether it would be prudent to establish a committee of the Board of Directors to allow for flexible and timely oversight and support of management in its discussions with Cisco under circumstances where it might not be practicable to frequently assemble the full Board of Directors. After discussion, the Board of Directors approved the formation of a committee (the “Transaction Committee”), comprised of Graham Smith, Kenneth Hao, David Tunnell and Rick Wallace, to facilitate the Board of Directors’ active involvement in Splunk’s discussions and consideration of strategic alternatives, including potential negotiations with Cisco (or any other party), but without authority to approve any transaction or the terms and conditions thereof. The Transaction Committee was not created to address any actual or perceived conflict of interest, and the members of the Transaction Committee were not paid any additional compensation for serving on the Transaction Committee. The Board of Directors also discussed the need to retain a financial advisor to conduct financial analyses of any proposal or proposed transaction (and the terms and conditions thereof), to assist Splunk in negotiations and to help the Board of Directors evaluate strategic alternatives. After discussion, the Board of Directors determined to engage Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley based on their respective pre-existing relationships with Splunk, including Qatalyst Partners’ engagement during the discussions with Cisco in 2022 as well as its knowledge of Splunk and Morgan Stanley’s long-standing relationship advising Splunk since its initial public offering and ongoing strategic dialogue with Splunk, as well as their respective reputations, expertise and experience advising enterprise software companies in connection with transactions of a similar nature. The Board of Directors authorized and instructed the management team to negotiate the terms of these engagements, subject to review and approval of the Board of Directors or the Transaction Committee.

On June 27, 2023, the Transaction Committee met to consult with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley regarding Cisco’s acquisition proposal. Members of Splunk’s management team (including Mr.Steele) and representatives of Skadden also attended the meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley together reviewed their preliminary financial analyses of Cisco’s $130 per share acquisition proposal. After

[TABLE OF CONTENTS](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000114036123050211/ny20011269x2_defm14a.htm#TOC)

considering the preliminary financial analyses presented by representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley, the Transaction Committee concluded that Cisco’s $130 per share offer price was not compelling but that Splunk should continue to engage in discussions with Cisco to determine whether there was a path to a transaction that was in the best interests of Splunk and its stockholders.

At this meeting, the Transaction Committee also discussed whether Splunk should conduct a “market check” to determine if any other third parties might have interest in a strategic transaction with Splunk at this time. To determine whether the Transaction Committee should conduct a “market check,” representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley together reviewed a list of third parties that might have strategic interest in a transaction with Splunk based on their respective business profiles and expressed strategic plans and initiatives, as well as an ability to execute a transaction with a company with a market capitalization as large as Splunk’s. Members of the Transaction Committee and Mr.Steele discussed each of the potential acquirors identified and determined, based on their business insights and the advice of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley, that none of these parties were likely to have interest in pursuing a strategic transaction with Splunk at this time or in the near future, given among other things, the size of the transaction, other strategic priorities of strategic buyers at the time that would prevent them from pursuing such large-scale M&A opportunities. Members of the Transaction Committee actively involved in private equity investing observed that financial sponsors were unlikely to have interest in a transaction with Splunk for a variety of reasons, including the size of the transaction, Splunk’s financial profile and the then-current market conditions for leveraged acquisition financing. The Transaction Committee also noted that Splunk had not received any inbound interest from third parties in a strategic transaction with Splunk following the above-mentioned press reports of Splunk’s strategic discussions with Cisco in 2022. After such discussions, including consideration of the potential downsides of a market check, the Transaction Committee determined not to initiate a market check at this time.

At the end of the meeting, members of the Transaction Committee and Mr.Steele discussed potential responses to Cisco with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley and the appropriate means by which to convey Splunk’s response. Following this discussion, members of Splunk’s management team (including Mr.Steele) departed the meeting so the Transaction Committee could meet in executive session with representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Morgan Stanley and Skadden.

On June 29, 2023, based on guidance and instruction from the Transaction Committee, Mr. Steele called Mr.Robbins to convey Splunk’s feedback on Cisco’s $130 per share acquisition proposal. Mr.Steele informed Mr.Robbins that Splunk’s Board of Directors and management team were confident in Splunk’s standalone business prospects and that Cisco’s proposed offer price of $130 per share did not reflect a price for Splunk that was more attractive than Splunk’s standalone business prospects and long-term value. Mr.Robbins acknowledged Splunk’s response and requested additional information on Splunk’s business, technology and financial outlook in order to help Cisco refine its financial model for a potential acquisition of Splunk, including potential synergies that might be unlocked by a strategic combination of the two companies. Mr.Steele suggested the companies’ financial advisors discuss the matter further.

On July 5, 2023, a representative of Tidal Partners LLC (“Tidal Partners”), Cisco’s financial advisor, spoke with a representative of Qatalyst Partners and informed that Cisco would consider making a revised offer to acquire Splunk but needed additional diligence information from Splunk in order to determine whether to do so, and if so, what revised offer price to propose. In particular, Cisco was interested in better understanding Splunk’s technology, products and platform. The Tidal Partners representative indicated that Cisco would send a supplemental information request list to Splunk in order to focus Splunk’s information gathering efforts in support of Cisco’s financial modeling work.

On July 10, 2023, the Transaction Committee convened a meeting to discuss the status of Splunk’s engagement with Cisco. Members of Splunk’s management team (including Mr.Steele) and representatives of Skadden, Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. Mr. Steele updated the Transaction Committee on the management teams’ recent discussions with Cisco, including Mr.Steele’s conversation with Mr.Robbins and Cisco’s request to receive additional information to enable it to refine its business and financial analysis of a business combination with Splunk. While Mr.Robbins had not committed to revise Cisco’s offer price, he had requested the additional information to assess whether doing so was feasible. The Transaction Committee supported Splunk’s efforts to compile and share the supplemental information that Cisco had requested and authorized and instructed Splunk to do so. Following this discussion, members of Splunk’s management team (including Mr.Steele) departed the meeting so the Transaction Committee could meet in executive session with representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Morgan Stanley and Skadden. After some discussion, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley also

departed the meeting so that the members of the Transaction Committee could discuss the terms of Qatalyst Partners’ and Morgan Stanley’s engagement, including the respective relationship disclosure letters previously provided by each of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley to the Board of Directors. After discussion, the Transaction Committee determined to authorize and instruct Splunk to formally engage both Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley on the terms discussed, subject to completion of certain engagement details.

Following review and approval by the Transaction Committee of the negotiated engagement letters with each of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley, Splunk entered into a formal engagement letter with Qatalyst Partners on August 3, 2023, and a formal engagement letter with Morgan Stanley on August 16, 2023.

Between July 21, 2023, and August 3, 2023, representatives of Cisco and Splunk met in person several times to discuss, among other matters, Splunk’s business, technology, products and platform, as well as potential synergies that could be achieved through a combination of the two companies.

On July 31, 2023, Splunk completed the second quarter of its fiscal year 2024. Following the completion of the quarter, Splunk’s management team (1) refined its preliminary projections of Splunk’s fiscal year 2024 financial results as included in the Interim Management Projections based, in part, on the full year outlook implied by the second quarter results (as updated, including certain projections of Splunk’s financial results for fiscal years 2027 through 2034 prepared by Splunk’s management by extrapolating from the foregoing financial projections, the “Updated Interim Management Projections”) and (2) prepared two additional sets of alternative long-term financial projections in order to give the Board of Directors a broader perspective on possible alternative financial outcomes if macroeconomic factors impacted near-term growth and if growth rates slowed more rapidly over time (the “Sensitivity Cases”). Splunk’s management team also discussed its second quarter financial results with representatives of Cisco to explain the management team’s views on the implications of these results for Splunk’s full fiscal year 2024 estimates. Following this meeting, Splunk shared a revised fiscal year 2024 forecast with Cisco.

Following this further refinement, Splunk publicly reported its second quarter financial results on August 23, 2023. The earnings announcement reported that Splunk’s (1) total annual recurring revenue was $3.858 billion, up 16% year-over-year; (2) total revenues were $911 million, with cloud revenue growing 29% to $445 million; (3) GAAP operating expenses declined 2%year-over-year; (4) non-GAAP operating expenses declined 3% year-over-year; (5)trailing twelve-month operating cash flow was $827 million, up 247% year-over-year; (6) trailing twelve-month free cash flow was $805 million, up 273%year-over-year; and (7) number of customers with total ARR greater than $1 million was 834, an increase of 111 year-over-year. Following the earnings announcement, Splunk’s closing stock price increased from $99.93, as of the close of trading on the day of the earnings announcement, to $112.83, as of the close of trading on the day after the earnings announcement.

On August 25, 2023, Splunk received a revised non-binding indication of interest from Cisco to acquire Splunk for $142 per share in cash, representing a premium of 26% to Splunk’s closing stock price of $112.83 on August 24, 2023.

On August 27, 2023, the Transaction Committee convened a meeting to discuss the status of Splunk’s engagement with Cisco. Members of Splunk’s management team (including Mr.Steele) and representatives of Skadden, Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. At the request of the Board of Directors, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley together reviewed their preliminary financial analyses of Cisco’s $142 per share acquisition proposal based on publicly available information and Splunk’s management team’s Updated Interim Management Projections and Sensitivity Cases. The Transaction Committee considered and discussed the preliminary financial analyses and concluded that Cisco’s revised offer price of $142 per share continued to undervalue Splunk and was less attractive than Splunk’s standalone business and long-term value prospects. After discussion, the Transaction Committee authorized and instructed Qatalyst Partners, on behalf of Splunk, to deliver to Tidal Partners, on behalf of Cisco, a counterproposal for Cisco to acquire Splunk for $168 per share in cash. Following this discussion, members of Splunk’s management team (including Mr.Steele) departed the meeting so the Transaction Committee could meet in executive session with representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Morgan Stanley and Skadden.

Later that day, a representative of Qatalyst Partners verbally presented the counterproposal of $168 per share in cash to a representative of Tidal Partners.

On August 28, 2023, a representative of Tidal Partners called a representative of Qatalyst Partners and verbally conveyed a revised proposal by Cisco to acquire Splunk for $146 per share in cash, reflecting a premium of 25% to Splunk’s closing stock price of $117.15 on August 28, 2023.

On August 29, 2023, the Transaction Committee convened a meeting to discuss Cisco’s latest acquisition proposal as conveyed by Tidal Partners. Members of Splunk’s management team (including Mr.Steele) and representatives of Skadden, Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley together reviewed the verbal counterproposal for Cisco to acquire Splunk for $146 per share in cash that Tidal Partners had conveyed the previous day and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley together reviewed, at the request of the Board of Directors, their preliminary financial analyses of the proposal based on publicly available information and the Updated Interim Management Projections and Sensitivity Cases. A representative of Skadden also gave the Transaction Committee a preliminary assessment of the regulatory considerations of the proposed transaction and reviewed the directors’ fiduciary duties in connection with their evaluation of a potential sale of Splunk in general and Cisco’s interest in particular. The Transaction Committee considered and discussed the preliminary financial analyses and concluded that Cisco’s revised offer price of $146 per share continued to undervalue Splunk and was less attractive than Splunk’s standalone business and long-term value prospects. After discussion, the Transaction Committee authorized and instructed Qatalyst Partners to deliver a counterproposal to Tidal Partners of $160 per share in cash. Following this discussion, members of Splunk’s management team (including Mr.Steele) departed the meeting so the Transaction Committee could meet in executive session with Splunk’s outside financial and legal advisors. Later the same day, a representative of Qatalyst Partners called a representative of Tidal Partners to convey that the Transaction Committee would be prepared to accept (and recommend to the full Board of Directors to accept) a revised offer to acquire Splunk at a transaction price of $160 per share in cash.

On August 30, 2023, a representative of Tidal Partners called a representative of Qatalyst Partners to convey that Mr.Robbins intended to call Mr. Steele to discuss Cisco’s perspective on the latest price negotiations and Cisco’s assessment of an appropriate valuation of Splunk. Later that day, Mr. Robbins called Mr. Steele to discuss the proposed transaction. During the call, Mr.Robbins presented a revised proposal for Cisco to acquire Splunk for $152 per share in cash, reflecting a premium of 26% to Splunk’s closing stock price of $120.28 on August 30, 2023.

Later that day, the Transaction Committee convened a meeting to discuss Cisco’s latest acquisition proposal. Members of Splunk’s management team (including Mr.Steele) and representatives of Skadden, Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. At the meeting, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley together reviewed their preliminary financial analyses with respect to Cisco’s latest proposal to acquire Splunk for $152 per share in cash based on publicly available information and the Updated Interim Management Projections and Sensitivity Cases. Following the discussion, the Transaction Committee authorized and instructed Mr.Steele to inform Mr.Robbins that the Transaction Committee would be prepared to support (and would recommend to the full Board of Directors to accept) a transaction price of $158 per share in cash. The Transaction Committee agreed to reconvene following Mr.Steele’s conversation with Mr.Robbins. Following this discussion, members of Splunk’s management team (including Mr.Steele) departed the meeting so the Transaction Committee could meet in executive session with Splunk’s outside financial and legal advisors.

Later that same day, Mr.Steele called Mr.Robbins and Mr. Steele indicated that the Transaction Committee was prepared to accept (and recommend to the full Board of Directors to accept) a transaction price of $158 per share in cash.

Later that evening, a representative of Tidal Partners called a representative of Qatalyst Partners to preview that Mr.Robbins would again call Mr.Steele to convey another revised verbal proposal to acquire Splunk. Mr. Robbins called Mr.Steele by telephone that evening and indicated that Cisco would be prepared to acquire Splunk for $156 per share in cash, reflecting a premium of 30% of Splunk’s closing stock price on August 30, 2023 of $120.28.

Following this conversation, the Transaction Committee convened another meeting on August 30, 2023. Members of Splunk’s management team (including Mr.Steele) and representatives of Skadden, Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley together reviewed their preliminary financial analyses of Cisco’s latest proposal to acquire Splunk for $156 per share in cash based on publicly available information and the Updated Interim Management Projections and Sensitivity Cases. Following discussion, subject to the authorization of the Board of Directors, the Transaction Committee authorized and

instructed Mr.Steele to finalize negotiations with Cisco at the highest price Mr.Steele could obtain from Cisco. Following this discussion, members of Splunk’s management team (including Mr.Steele) departed the meeting so the Transaction Committee could meet in executive session with Splunk’s outside financial and legal advisors.

On August 31, 2023, Mr. Steele called Mr.Robbins and Mr. Robbins made a verbal offer for Cisco to acquire Splunk for $157 per share in cash, reflecting a premium of 29% to Splunk’s closing stock price of $121.26 on August 31, 2023, subject to Splunk’s acceptance of a customary exclusivity agreement.

Later that day, Splunk received a revised non-binding indication of interest from Cisco to acquire Splunk for $157 per share in cash and a copy of a proposed exclusivity agreement (the “Exclusivity Agreement”) providing Cisco with the exclusive right to negotiate with Splunk for a period of 30 days following execution of the Exclusivity Agreement.

On September 1, 2023, the Board of Directors convened a meeting to consider Cisco’s proposal to acquire Splunk for $157 per share in cash. Members of Splunk’s management team and representatives of Skadden, Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. Mr.Steele updated the Board of Directors on the discussions with Cisco since the last meeting of the full Board of Directors, including the details of Cisco’s latest proposal to acquire Splunk for $157 per share in cash and Mr. Smith provided a summary of the work the Transaction Committee had completed in evaluating and overseeing the negotiation process, due diligence and other transaction-related matters. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley together reviewed their preliminary financial analyses of Cisco’s proposal based on publicly available information and the Updated Interim Management Projections and Sensitivity Cases. A representative of Skadden then provided an overview of the directors’ fiduciary duties in connection with their evaluation of a potential sale of Splunk in general and Cisco’s interest in particular. In light of Cisco’s request for exclusive negotiations and the passage of time since the Board of Directors considered the issue in June 2023, the Board of Directors also revisited whether to conduct a market check prior to entering into the Exclusivity Agreement with Cisco in order to determine whether any other third parties might have interest in a strategic transaction with Splunk at this time. Members of the Transaction Committee confirmed that they had discussed the advisability of conducting a market check at various times during negotiations with Cisco and determined not to initiate a market check for the reasons discussed by the Board of Directors in June 2023. After considering the issues previously discussed by the Board of Directors in June 2023, the transaction price being proposed by Cisco and the state of Splunk’s business and financial outlook, the Board of Directors determined that a market check was unlikely to yield additional interest in a transaction with Splunk at this time. Following discussion of the foregoing matters, the Board of Directors authorized and instructed Splunk to commence negotiation of definitive transaction agreements and documentation with Cisco at a transaction price of $157 per share in cash and to enter into an exclusivity agreement with Cisco to enable the parties to negotiate such definitive agreements and to enable Cisco to complete its confirmatory due diligence review of Splunk. Following this discussion, members of Splunk’s management team (including Mr.Steele) departed the meeting so the Board of Directors could meet in executive session with Splunk’s outside financial and legal advisors.

On September 2, 2023, Splunk and Cisco entered into the Exclusivity Agreement and commenced confirmatory due diligence and negotiation of definitive agreements for the proposed transaction.

On September 5, 2023, Mr. Robbins called Mr.Steele to reiterate his enthusiasm for the proposed transaction and his commitment to completing confirmatory due diligence and negotiation of definitive agreements as expeditiously as possible. In addition, Mr.Robbins shared Cisco’s desired targeted announcement date of September 21, 2023 and preliminary expectations for the communications roll-out following the public announcement of a the proposed transaction.

On September 6, 2023, Simpson sent to Skadden an initial draft of the merger agreement for the proposed transaction. Such merger agreement indicated that Cisco would seek to negotiate and finalize voting agreements with certain key Splunk stockholders as a condition to entering into the merger agreement with Splunk.

Over the course of the ensuing period of time until the parties entered into the merger agreement on September 20, 2023, Cisco and its advisors continued their confirmatory due diligence review of Splunk and representatives of Splunk, Cisco, Skadden and Simpson negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and other definitive documentation for the proposed transaction.

On September 7, 2023, a representative of Simpson called a representative of Skadden seeking permission for Cisco to commence discussions with Mr.Steele and potentially other key senior executives of Splunk regarding their

38

respective roles with Cisco following the completion of the proposed transaction. The representative of Simpson conveyed Cisco’s view that Mr.Steele and potentially other key senior executives were critical to Cisco’s willingness to proceed with the proposed transaction, so Cisco was conditioning its willingness to enter a definitive transaction agreement with Splunk on the completion of an employment agreement with Mr.Steele and potentially other key executives to be determined after further discussion (all of which would only become effective upon the completion of the proposed transaction). Mr.Steele and the Transaction Committee discussed this request and determined to authorize Cisco to discuss Mr.Steele’s role at Cisco but not his compensation at this time, and Mr.Steele agreed to abide by the parameters of this conditional authorization until the Transaction Committee authorized compensation related discussions. The Transaction Committee also authorized and instructed Mr.Steele to provide oversight of Cisco’s engagement with other key senior executives of Splunk to ensure such engagement did not affect, interfere with or disrupt ongoing negotiations with Cisco regarding the transaction in general. A representative of Skadden conveyed the Transaction Committee’s conditional authorization to Simpson. Thereafter, Mr.Steele had numerous discussions with Cisco regarding his role at Cisco following the completion of the proposed transaction but compensation matters were not discussed. During this period of time, Mr.Steele also discussed with representatives of Cisco the potential role various other senior Splunk executives may have with following the completion of the transaction. Following those discussions, it was agreed that Cisco would only seek to negotiate and finalize employment agreements with two other senior Splunk executives as a condition to entering into a definitive transaction agreement with Splunk.

On September 10, 2023, a representative of Simpson sent a draft of a voting agreement to representatives of Skadden, pursuant to which H&F would be required, among other things, to vote their shares of Common Stock in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and the merger, and against any competing transaction, so long as the merger agreement remained in effect. Over the course of the ensuing period of time until the parties entered into the merger agreement on September 20, 2023, representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, outside counsel to H&F, Simpson and Skadden negotiated and finalized the terms of the voting agreement.

On September 13, 2023, the Board of Directors and the standing committees thereof held previously scheduled meetings. During these meetings, the Board of Directors and the Talent and Compensation Committee thereof discussed the status of negotiations with Cisco and its advisors and provided guidance and instruction on various transaction related issues under negotiation with Cisco, including the terms of a potential employee retention scheme.

Following this meeting of the Board of Directors, Splunk’s management team and Skadden negotiated the final terms of the definitive agreement for the proposed transaction with Cisco and Simpson. The Transaction Committee provided guidance and instruction to management and Skadden throughout these negotiations, meeting on September 17, 18 and 19, 2023 to discuss the status and terms of such negotiations.

In addition, following the September 13 meeting of the Board of Directors, Cisco also began discussions and negotiations with Mr.Steele, Mr.Casey and Christian Smith, Splunk’s Senior Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer, regarding their employment with Cisco. On or around September 14, 2023, Cisco requested permission to propose and negotiate full terms of the senior executives’ employment agreements, including compensation-related items. After discussion and consideration of the progress of Splunk’s negotiations on the overall transaction with Cisco, the Transaction Committee authorized Mr.Steele, Mr.Casey and Mr.Smith to negotiate their employment with Cisco, including compensation-related items. Thereafter, all three executives and their personal legal counsel negotiated the terms of their respective employment agreements with Cisco and Simpson.

On September 20, 2023, the Board of Directors convened a meeting to discuss the fully negotiated terms of the definitive agreement for the proposed transaction with Cisco. Members of Splunk’s management team and representatives of Skadden, Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley also attended the meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board of Directors its financial analyses of the merger consideration of $157 per share of Splunk common stock. Subsequently, a representative of Morgan Stanley presented Morgan Stanley’s financial analyses of the proposed transaction. A representative of Skadden then presented a detailed outline of the fully negotiated definitive merger agreement and related documentation for the proposed transaction. The Board of Directors was then presented with a summary of the terms of the proposed employment arrangements with Mr. Steele, Mr.Casey and Mr.Smith. After discussion among the Board of Directors and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, Morgan Stanley and Skadden, (1)a representative of Qatalyst Partners delivered Qatalyst Partners’ oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, dated September 20, 2023, to the Board of Directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various limitations, qualifications and conditions set forth in the Qatalyst Partners’ written opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms

Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger

Recommendation of the Board of Directors

The Board of Directors has unanimously: (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Splunk and Splunk Stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL and consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; (ii)approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Splunk, the performance by Splunk of its covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) resolved to recommend that Splunk Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR,” on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

Reasons for the Merger

In the course of reaching its determination and recommendation, the Board of Directors consulted with Splunk management, Skadden, Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley. The Board of Directors considered a number of factors, including those below (which are not listed in any relative order of importance), all of which it viewed as generally supporting its (i) approval of the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by Splunk, the performance by Splunk of its covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (ii) resolution to recommend that Splunk Stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL:

•the current and historical market prices of Splunk common stock, including the market performance of the Splunk common stock relative to those of other participants in Splunk’s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the Per Share Merger Consideration constituted a premium of approximately 31% over Splunk’s closing stock price of $119.59 on September 20, 2023 (the trading day prior to the public announcement of the Merger), and a premium of approximately 38% over Splunk’s 30-day volume-weighted average closing share price through that date;

•the comparably low price per share at which many Splunk Stockholders acquired their stock compared to the Per Share Merger Consideration;

•the current and prospective business environment in which Splunk operates, including international, national and local economic conditions, the competitive environment and the likely effect of these factors on Splunk and the execution of Splunk’s standalone strategic plans;

•the belief of the Board of Directors, based upon the course of negotiations with Parent (as described in more detail under the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Background of the Merger”), that the Per Share Merger Consideration represents the highest price that Parent was willing to pay and that the terms of the Merger Agreement include the most favorable terms to Splunk, in the aggregate, to which Parent was willing to agree;

•the potential risk of losing the favorable opportunity with Parent in the event Splunk sought to pursue discussions with all third parties who may be interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with Splunk prior to entry into the Merger Agreement and the potential negative effect that such a process might have on Splunk’s business;

•the high degree of certainty that the closing would be achieved in a timely manner, in view of the terms of the Merger Agreement;

•the view of the Board of Directors that the Per Share Merger Consideration was more favorable to Splunk Stockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than the potential value that might result from other alternatives reasonably available to Splunk, based upon the Board of Directors’ extensive knowledge of Splunk’s business, assets, financial condition and results of operations, its competitive position and historical and projected financial performance, and the belief that the Per Share Merger Consideration represented an attractive and comparatively certain value for Splunk Stockholders relative to the risk-adjusted prospects for Splunk on a standalone basis;

•the oral opinion of Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Board of Directors, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of September 20, 2023, and based upon and subject to the various limitations, qualifications, assumptions and conditions set forth in the Qatalyst Partners’ written opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of Splunk common stock (other than Parent or any Affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, as set forth in such opinion as more fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of Qatalyst Partners” which full text of the written opinion is attached as Annex C-1 to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in their entirety;

•the financial analyses presentation and the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley rendered to the Board of Directors, subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, that, as of September 20, 2023, and based upon and subject to the various limitations, qualifications, assumptions and other matters, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Splunk common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of Splunk common stock, as more fully described below under the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,” which full text of the written opinion is attached as Annex C-2 to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in their entirety;

•the reputation, management and financial resources of Parent and its extensive history of successfully completing transactions, as well as the existing and positive commercial relationship between Splunk and Parent;

•the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents, including the following:

○Splunk’s ability to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a Superior Proposal, subject to certain conditions of the Merger Agreement and paying Parent a termination fee of $1,000,000,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated—an amount which the Board of Directors believed, based upon the advice of its financial and legal advisors, was unlikely to deter third parties from making Acquisition Proposals;

○the conditions to closing contained in the Merger Agreement, which are limited in number and scope, and which, in the case of the condition related to the accuracy of Splunk’s representations and warranties, is generally subject to materiality or a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties”) qualification;

○the requirement that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Splunk common stock;

○the fact that Splunk has sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in the ordinary course prior to the consummation of the Merger;

○the provision of the Merger Agreement allowing the Board of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation and to terminate the Merger Agreement, in certain circumstances relating to the presence of a Superior Proposal (or to effect a change of recommendation in response to an intervening event) subject to the applicable procedures, terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (including, if applicable, payment of a termination fee) (for more information, see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Board of Directors’ Recommendation Change; Change of Recommendation,” “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement” and “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”);

○the absence of a financing condition in the Merger Agreement and confirmation that Parent has, and will have at the Effective Time, sufficient funds available to consummate the Merger;

○the end date of March 20, 2025;

○the requirement that, in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under certain circumstances, Parent will pay Splunk a termination fee of $1,478,000,000, as more fully described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”; and

○the fact that the Voting and Support Agreement terminates in the event that the Merger Agreement is validly terminated in any manner thereunder, as more fully described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Voting and Support Agreement.”

The Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):

•the fact that Splunk would no longer exist as an independent, publicly traded company, and Splunk Stockholders would no longer participate in any future earnings or growth and would not benefit from any potential future appreciation in value of Splunk;

•the risks and costs to Splunk if the Merger is not completed in a timely manner or at all, including the potential adverse effect on Splunk’s ability to attract and retain key personnel, the diversion of management and employee attention and the potential disruptive effect on Splunk’s day-to-day operations and Splunk’s relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties, any or all of which risks and costs, among other things, could adversely affect Splunk’s overall competitive position and the trading price of its common stock;

•the requirement under certain circumstances that Splunk pay Parent a termination fee following termination of the Merger Agreement, including if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Splunk in order to enter into a Superior Proposal or by Parent because the Board of Directors effects a Change of Recommendation;

•if Parent fails to complete the Merger as a result of a breach of the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, remedies may be limited to the termination fee payable by Parent described above, which may be inadequate to compensate Splunk for the damage caused, and if available, other rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce, and the success of any such action may be uncertain;

•the restrictions on the conduct of Splunk’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which may delay or prevent Splunk from undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the Merger and that, absent the Merger Agreement, Splunk might have pursued;

•the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to Splunk Stockholders that are U.S. Holders;

•the fact that, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Splunk is unable to solicit other Acquisition Proposals;

•the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger (many of which are payable whether or not the Merger is consummated) and the substantial time and effort of Splunk management required to complete the Merger, which may disrupt its business operations and have a negative effect on its financial results;

•the risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of termination of the Merger Agreement on the trading price of Splunk common stock;

•the fact that the completion of the Merger requires certain regulatory clearances and consents, including under applicable antitrust laws and certain foreign investment laws, which clearances and consents could subject the Merger to unforeseen delays and risks;

•the fact that Splunk’s directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Splunk Stockholders generally (see below under the caption “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger”); and

•the possible loss of key management or other personnel and potential distraction of employees of Splunk during the pendency of the Merger.

The foregoing discussion of reasons for the recommendation to adopt the Merger Agreement is not meant to be exhaustive but addresses the material information and factors considered by the Board of Directors in consideration of its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, in considering the information and factors described above, individual members of the Board of Directors each applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have given differing weights to differing factors. The Board of Directors based its unanimous recommendation on the totality of the information presented. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking statements that should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Forward-Looking Statements.”

Opinions of Qatalyst Partners LP and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP

The Company retained Qatalyst Partners LP (“Qatalyst Partners”) to act as its financial advisor in connection with a potential transaction such as the Merger and to evaluate whether the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the Splunk Stockholders (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The Company selected Qatalyst Partners to act as the Company’s financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners’ long-standing relationship with the Company as well as Qatalyst Partners’ qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company and the industry in which it operates. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the meeting of the Board of Directors on September 20, 2023, Qatalyst Partners rendered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations, and other matters set forth therein, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the Splunk Stockholders (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Qatalyst Partners delivered its written opinion, dated September 20, 2023, to the Board of Directors following the meeting of the Board of Directors.

The full text of Qatalyst Partners’ written opinion, dated September 20, 2023, is attached hereto as Annex C-1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. Splunk Stockholders should read the opinion carefully in its entirety. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion was provided to the Board of Directors and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the Splunk Stockholders (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders, and it does not address any other aspect of the Merger. It does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Splunk common stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Splunk common stock will trade or otherwise be transferable at any time. The summary of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C-1.

In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated September 20, 2023, certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements, and other business and financial information of the Company. Qatalyst also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including the Baseline Management Projections, the Sensitivity 1 Projections and the Sensitivity 2 Projections (which we refer to, together, as the “Management Projections”), each as described in more detail in “—Management Projections—Summary of Management Projections.” Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Splunk common stock and compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Splunk common stock with that of certain other selected publicly traded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions, participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company, Parent and their financial and legal advisors, and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Qatalyst Partners deemed appropriate.

In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by the Company. With respect to the Management Projections, Qatalyst was advised by the management of the Company, and Qatalyst Partners assumed based on discussions with the management of the Company and the Board of Directors, that the Management Projections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners expressed no view as to the Management Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the terms of the draft Merger Agreement reviewed by Qatalyst Partners would not differ materially from the final executed Merger Agreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay of any terms or conditions. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the Merger. Qatalyst Partners has relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products. In arriving at Qatalyst Partners’ opinion, Qatalyst Partners was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any party with respect to an acquisition, business combination or other extraordinary transaction involving the Company. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion has been approved by its opinion committee in accordance with its customary practice.

Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of the opinion may affect Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with,

44

the terms of the Merger Agreement by the Splunk Stockholders (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), and Qatalyst Partners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.

The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion dated September 20, 2023. The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners’ opinion. For purposes of its analyses, Qatalyst Partners utilized, among other things, the Management Projections and the third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the future financial performance of the Company as of September 19, 2023 (which we refer to as the “Street Estimates”). Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners’ financial analyses.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a range of potential per-share present values for Splunk common stock as of July 31, 2023 (which is the end of the Company’s most recent completed fiscal quarter and most recent publicly available balance sheet date), with respect to each of the Baseline Management Projections, the Sensitivity 1 Projections and the Sensitivity 2 Projections, by:

•adding:

○the implied net present values of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows (which are referred to as the “UFCF”) of the Company based on each of the Baseline Management Projections, the Sensitivity 1 Projections and the Sensitivity 2 Projections, as applicable, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 through fiscal year 2034 (which implied present values were calculated using a range of discount rates of 12.0% to 14.0%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for the Company);

○the implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of the Company, calculated by applying to the Company’s estimated UFCF in fiscal year 2034 based on each of the Baseline Management Projections, the Sensitivity 1 Projections and the Sensitivity 2 Projections, as applicable, a perpetuity growth rate range of 3.0% to 5.0% (which was chosen based on Qatalyst Partners’ professional judgment and experience), and discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates used in item (a) above; and

•subtracting:

○net debt, as of July 31, 2023 (including approximately $42 million of non-current investments and pro forma for the paydown of the Company’s 2023 Notes, due on September 15, 2023), as provided by management of the Company; and

•dividing the resulting amount by the number of fully diluted shares of Splunk common stock outstanding (calculated using the treasury stock method, taking into account the restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, and in-the-money stock options) as of September 18, 2023, all as provided by management of the Company, with each of the above-referenced estimated future UFCFs and terminal values having also been adjusted for the degree of estimated dilution to current Splunk Stockholders through each respective applicable period (approximately 2% annually throughout the projection period) due to the estimated net effects of equity issuances and cancellations related to future equity compensation, which estimates of future dilution were provided by management of the Company.

Based on an analysis of the CY2024E revenue multiples for the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 4.0x to 7.0x. Qatalyst Partners then applied this range to the Company’s revenue estimates for fiscal year 2025, based on each of the Baseline Management Projections, the Management Sensitivities and the Street Estimates. For purposes of this analysis, Qatalyst Partners used the Company’s fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, as a proxy for calendar year 2024.

Based on an analysis of the CY2024E LFCF multiples for the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 15.0x to 27.0x. Qatalyst Partners then applied this range to the Company’s levered free cash flow estimates for fiscal year 2025, based on each of the Baseline Management Projections, the Management Sensitivities and the Street Estimates. For purposes of this analysis, Qatalyst Partners used the Company’s fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, as a proxy for calendar year 2024.

No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the control of the Company, such as the impact of competition on the Company’s business or the industry in general, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the Company’s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in general. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.

Selected Transactions Analysis

Qatalyst Partners compared sixty-eight selected public company transactions, including transactions involving companies participating in similar lines of business to the Company or with similar business models, similar financial performance or other relevant or similar characteristics.

For each of the selected transactions listed below, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, (a) the implied fully diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the next-twelve-months’ revenue of the target company (which are referred to as the “NTM revenue multiples”), (b) the implied fully diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the next-twelve-months’ EBITDA of the target company (which are referred to as the “NTM EBITDA multiples”), and (c) the implied fully diluted equity value of the target company as a multiple of third-party research analyst consensus estimates of the next-twelve-months’ levered free cash flow of the target company (which are referred to as the “NTM LFCF multiples”).

Based on the analysis of the NTM revenue multiples for the selected transactions and its professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 4.5x to 8.0x, then applied this range to the Company’s next-twelve months’ revenue estimates (calculated as the four quarters ending on July 31, 2024) based on the Street Estimates. Based on the fully diluted shares of Splunk common stock outstanding as of September 18, 2023 (calculated utilizing the same methodology as used in the above discounted cash flow analysis) as provided by management of the Company, this analysis implied a range of values for Splunk common stock of approximately $97.37 to $178.26 per share.

Based on the analysis of the NTM EBITDA multiples for the selected transactions and its professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 18.0x to 34.0x, then applied this range to the Company’s next-twelve-months’ EBITDA estimates (calculated as the four quarters ending on July 31, 2024) based on the Street Estimates. Based on the fully diluted shares of Splunk common stock outstanding as of September 18, 2023 (calculated utilizing the same methodology as used in the above discounted cash flow analysis) as provided by management of the Company, this analysis implied a range of values for Splunk common stock of approximately $88.22 to $172.96 per share.

Based on the analysis of the NTM LFCF multiples for the selected transactions and its professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative multiple range of 20.0x to 32.0x, then applied this range to the Company’s next-twelve-months’ leveraged free cash flow estimates (calculated as the four quarters ending on July 31, 2024) based on the Street Estimates. Based on the fully diluted shares of Splunk common stock outstanding as of September 18, 2023 (calculated utilizing the same methodology as used in the above discounted cash flow analysis) as provided by management of the Company, this analysis implied a range of values for Splunk common stock of approximately $107.27 to $171.63 per share.

No company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to the Company or the Merger. In evaluating the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, such as the impact of competition on the Company’s business or the industry

generally, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the Company’s financial condition and prospects or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to which they are being compared. Individual multiples or mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected transactional data. Because of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the Merger, Qatalyst Partners cautioned against placing undue reliance on this information.

Miscellaneous

In connection with the review of the Merger by the Board of Directors, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Qatalyst Partners’ view of the actual value of the Company. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Any estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.

Qatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the Splunk Stockholders (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent), to such holders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the price at which Splunk common stock might actually trade or otherwise be transferable at any time.

Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors considered by the Board of Directors in deciding to approve the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board of Directors with respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the Splunk Stockholders (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) or of whether the Board of Directors would have been willing to agree to different consideration. The Per Share Merger Consideration payable in the Merger was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and was approved by the Board of Directors. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to the Company or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.

Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst may at any time hold long or short positions and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates. During the two-year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners’ opinion, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and the Company or Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company, or Parent and their respective affiliates for which Qatalyst would expect to receive compensation.

Under the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided the Company with financial advisory services in connection with the Merger for which it will be paid an amount currently estimated at approximately $68.0 million, $7.5 million of which was payable upon delivery of its opinion (regardless of the conclusion reached in the opinion), and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, the closing of the Merger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for certain expenses incurred in performing its services. The Company has also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and employees and any person

controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, and certain expenses related to or arising out of Qatalyst Partners’ engagement.

Morgan Stanley expressed no view as to such financial projections or the assumptions on which they were based.

Events occurring after September 20, 2023, may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley has not assumed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

Summary of Financial Analyses

The following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion as of September 20, 2023, subsequently confirmed in writing as of such date to the Board of Directors. The following summary is not a complete description of Morgan Stanley’s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses and the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion.

In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and was directed by the Board of Directors to rely upon, among other matters, certain financial projections provided by Splunk’s management and referred to below as (1) Baseline Management Projections, (2) Sensitivity 1 Projections, and (3) Sensitivity 2 Projections (collectively, the “Management Projections”). The Management Projections are more fully described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Summary of Management Projections.” For purposes of the financial analyses summarized below, the term “Sensitivity Projections” refers to both Sensitivity 1 Projections and Sensitivity 2 Projections and is used where the results of such analyses under either case were the same. In addition, certain unaudited projections of Splunk’s financial results based on publicly available estimates of Morgan Stanley Research, as well as certain related extrapolations prepared by Morgan Stanley (the “Research Case”) were approved by Splunk’s management for inclusion in Morgan Stanley’s presentation to the Board of Directors on September 20, 2023. The Research Case was not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial analyses with respect to its opinion, but was included for reference purposes only in Morgan Stanley’s presentation to the Board of Directors and are summarized below. For purposes of Morgan Stanley’s financial analyses presented to the Board of Directors on September 20, 2023, and this section Splunk’s fiscal years are represented as calendar years, with each calendar year representing Splunk’s fiscal year ending on January 31 of the subsequent calendar year, such that, for example, a reference to Splunk’s estimated financial results for the calendar year 2023 would refer to Splunk’s estimated financial results for its fiscal year ending on January 31, 2024. In accordance with direction from the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley utilized the Management Projections in its financial analyses described below.

Public Trading Comparables Analysis

Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for Splunk with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates as of September 19, 2023, for companies, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, that share similar business characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue growth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics (the “comparable companies”).

Morgan Stanley analyzed (1) the ratio of price (“P”) for each of the comparable companies to estimated levered free cash flow (“LFCF”) for calendar year 2024 and (2) the ratio of aggregate value (“AV”) for each of the comparable companies utilizing publicly available financial information as of September 19, 2023, to estimated revenue for calendar year 2024. Morgan Stanley refers to these ratios as “AV/CY2024E Revenue Multiple” and “P/CY2024E LFCF Multiple,” respectively. For purposes of its analyses, Morgan Stanley defined (a) “aggregate value” as a company’s fully diluted equity value plus total debt, less cash and cash equivalents and equity investments, (b)“levered free cash flow” as a company’s operating cash flow, less capital expenditures and (c) “price” as a company’s closing stock trading price on September 19, 2023.

The following is a list of the selected comparable companies reviewed, together with the applicable P/CY2024E LFCF Multiple:

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of AV/CY2024E Revenue Multiple of 4.0x-6.0x and P/CY2024E LFCF Multiple of 15.0x-25.0x and applied these respective ranges to Splunk’s estimated revenue and estimated levered free cash flow for calendar year 2024 based on each of the Research Case and the Management Projections, respectively.

Based on the outstanding shares of Splunk common stock on a fully diluted basis as of September 18, 2023, and cash and debt balances as of July 31, 2023, each as provided by Splunk’s management, and certain adjustments to the debt balance based on (i) maturity and subsequent repayment out of cash of Splunk’s 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, (ii) make-whole costs associated with the remaining outstanding convertible notes, and (iii) estimated unwind values related to the treatment of Splunk’s outstanding Capped Call Transactions prepared by Morgan Stanley and reviewed and approved for Morgan Stanley’s use by Splunk’s management, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of Splunk common stock as follows:

No company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to Splunk. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Splunk’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Splunk’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Splunk and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.

Discounted Equity Value Analysis

Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into a theoretical estimate of the potential future equity value of a company as a function of such company’s estimated future revenue

and a range of trading multiples. The resulting estimated future implied equity value is subsequently discounted to arrive at an illustrative estimate of the implied present value for the company’s theoretical future implied stock price. In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity values per share of Splunk common stock on a standalone basis for each of the Research Case and the Management Projections, respectively.

To calculate these discounted fully diluted equity values, Morgan Stanley utilized calendar year 2026 revenue estimates under each of the Research Case and the Management Projections, respectively. Based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley applied a forward range of price to estimated levered free cash flow multiples (based on such multiples for the comparable companies) and aggregate value to estimated revenue multiples (based on such multiples for the comparable companies) to these levered free cash flow and revenue estimates, respectively, in order to reach a future-implied fully diluted aggregate value and equity value, respectively. For each of the Research Case and the Management Projections, Morgan Stanley applied a price to estimated levered free cash flow multiple range of 15.0x to 25.0x and an aggregate value to estimated revenue multiple range of 4.0x to 6.0x, each to generate an undiscounted implied future fully diluted equity value.

In each case, Morgan Stanley then discounted the resulting implied future fully diluted equity value to September 19, 2023, at a discount rate of 12.9 percent, which rate was selected by Morgan Stanley based on Splunk’s estimated cost of equity, estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and utilizing a 6 percent market risk premium, a risk-free rate of 4.3 percent based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of September 19, 2023, and a 1.43 predicted beta per Barra.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of such company. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of fully diluted equity values per share for Splunk common stock based on a discounted cash flow analysis to value Splunk as a standalone public company. Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from the Management Projections for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below.

Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (unburdened by stock-based compensation), (i) less taxes, (ii) less stock-based compensation expense, (iii) less capital expenditures, (iv) less capitalized deferred commissions, (v) plus amortization of deferred commissions, (vi) plus or minus changes in deferred revenue, and (vii) plus or minus changes in net working capital, for calendar years 2023 through 2033, which estimated unlevered free cash flow were provided for Morgan Stanley’s use by Splunk’s management. The free cash flow and terminal value were discounted to present values as of September 19, 2023, at a discount rate ranging from 11.6 percent to 13.5 percent. These discount rates were selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and

experience, to reflect Splunk’s estimated weighted average cost of capital. To calculate terminal values, Morgan Stanley utilized perpetual growth rates of 3.0 percent to 5.0 percent as part of its analyses, with such rates selected upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. The resulting aggregate value was then adjusted for net debt.

Based on the outstanding shares of Splunk common stock on a fully diluted basis as provided by Splunk’s management as of September 18, 2023, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of Splunk common stock as follows:

Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis

Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions multiples analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company based on publicly available financial terms. Morgan Stanley compared publicly available statistics for selected technology transactions by reviewing technology company transactions larger than $5 billion in aggregate value since 2011 (the “Selected Technology Transactions”). Morgan Stanley selected such comparable transactions based on its professional judgment and experience, including because they shared certain characteristics with the Merger, most notably because they were similar technology transactions since 2011. For such transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the multiple of aggregate value of the transaction to the estimated next 12 months’ (“NTM”) revenue and the multiple of the transaction price to the NTM levered free cash flow, in each case, based on publicly available information at the time of announcement or at the unaffected date of each such transaction.

No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to Splunk or the Merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Splunk’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Splunk’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Splunk and the industry, and in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value and fully diluted equity value of the transactions to which they are being compared. The fact that points in the range of implied present value per share of Splunk common stock derived from the valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the $157.00 per share in cash to be received pursuant to the Merger Agreement by holders of shares of Splunk common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) is not necessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the consideration for the Merger but is one of many factors Morgan Stanley considered.

Other Information

Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis with respect to its opinion but were noted as reference data for the Board of Directors.

Illustrative Precedent Transaction Premiums

Morgan Stanley performed an illustrative precedent transactions premiums analysis on the Selected Technology Transactions. For these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the distributions of the following financial statistics, where available: (i) the implied premium to the acquired company’s closing stock price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or, as applicable, on the last trading day prior to the stock price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news); and (ii) the implied premium to the acquired company’s 30-trading day average closing stock price prior to announcement (or, as applicable, on the last trading day prior to the stock price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news).

Based on its analysis of the premia for such transactions and based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected (1) a representative range of premia and applied such range to Splunk’s closing Splunk common stock price on September 19, 2023, and (2) a representative range of premia and applied such range to Splunk’s unaffected 30-trading day average closing Splunk common stock price on September 19, 2023. The following table summarized the results of Morgan Stanley’s analysis:

Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets

Morgan Stanley noted certain future public market trading price targets for Splunk common stock prepared and published by equity research analysts and provided to Morgan Stanley by Splunk management on August 30, 2023, which excluded reports published prior to Splunk’s release of its earnings results for the second fiscal quarter of 2023 and where no future public market trading price target was indicated. These targets reflected each analyst’s estimate of the future public market trading price of Splunk common stock. The range of undiscounted analyst price targets for Splunk common stock was $105.00 to $150.00 per share. Morgan Stanley then discounted the range of analyst price targets per share for Splunk common stock by one year at a rate of 12.9 percent, which was the discount rate selected by Morgan Stanley, upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, to reflect Splunk’s cost of equity, estimated using the capital asset pricing model method and utilizing a 6 percent market risk premium, a risk-free rate of 4.3 percent based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of September 19, 2023, and a 1.43 predicted beta per Barra. This analysis indicated an implied range of fully diluted equity values for Splunk common stock of $93.00 to $133.00 per share.

The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for Splunk common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of Splunk and future financial market conditions.

General

In connection with the review of the Merger by the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley’s view of the actual value of Splunk. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond Splunk’s control. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Splunk’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of Splunk and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.

Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Splunk common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) and in connection with the delivery of its opinion dated as of September 20, 2023, to the Board of Directors. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of Splunk common stock might actually trade.

The Per Share Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Splunk common stock (other than the holders of the Excluded Shares) was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Splunk and Parent and was approved by the Board of Directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Board of Directors during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to Splunk or the Board of Directors, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or a recommendation as to how Splunk Stockholders should vote at the Special Meeting.

Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of Directors to approve the Merger Agreement. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley’s customary practice.

Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the Parent, Splunk and their respective affiliates, or any other party, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument.

Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Board of Directors with financial advisory services and an opinion, described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex C-2, in connection with the Merger, and Splunk has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley an aggregate fee of approximately $45 million, approximately $7.5 million of which was earned following delivery of the opinion described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex C-2 (regardless of the conclusion reached in such opinion) and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, upon the closing of the Merger, Morgan Stanley may receive additional value resulting from adjustments to the 2027 Base Capped Call Transaction between Morgan Stanley and Splunk entered into in connection with Splunk’s issuance of 2027 Convertible Notes. Splunk has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, actually incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, Splunk has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain losses, claims, damages or liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with Morgan Stanley’s engagement.

In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have not received any fees from Splunk in connection with financial advisory services or financing services. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley’s opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates received aggregate fees of approximately less than $1 million in connection with financing services provided to Parent and majority-controlled affiliates of Parent. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory services and/or financing services to Splunk, Parent, and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.

Convertible Notes

The closing of the Merger will constitute both a “Fundamental Change” and a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” under each of the Convertible Notes Indentures (as defined below). Under the terms of the Convertible Notes Indentures, Splunk will be required to offer to repurchase the Convertible Notes (as defined below) in connection the Fundamental Change after the closing of the Merger at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes may convert their Convertible Notes in connection with the Make-Whole Fundamental Change during a period after the closing of the Merger and receive additional make-whole consideration determined by reference to the applicable make-whole table in the applicable Convertible Note Indenture. Following the closing the Merger, the cash Per Share Merger Consideration will become the reference property into which the 2025 Convertible Notes, 2026 Convertible Notes and 2027 Convertibles Notes (collectively, the “Convertible Notes”) are convertible.

“Convertible Note Indentures” means (i) the Indenture dated as of September 21, 2018, between Splunk and U.S.Bank National Association, as trustee, with respect to Splunk’s 1.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (such convertible notes, the “2025 Convertible Notes,” and such indenture, the “2025 Convertible Notes Indenture”), (ii)the Indenture dated as of July 9, 2021, between Splunk and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, with respect to Splunk’s 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (such convertible notes, the “2026 Convertible Notes,” and such indenture, the “2026 Convertible Notes Indenture”), and (iii) the Indenture dated as of June 5, 2020, between Splunk and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, with respect to Splunk’s 1.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (such convertible notes, the “2027 Convertible Notes,” and such indenture, the “2027 Convertible Notes Indenture”).

On September 18, 2018, in connection with the pricing of the 2025 Convertible Notes, Splunk entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “2025 Base Capped Call Transactions”) with Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse Capital LLC, Jefferies International Limited and UBS AG, London Branch, (the “2025 Capped Call Counterparties”). On September 20, 2018, in connection with the initial purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional 2025 Convertible Notes, Splunk entered into additional capped call transactions with the 2025 Capped Call Counterparties (the “2025 Additional Capped Call Transactions” and, together with the 2025 Base Capped Call Transactions the “2025 Capped Call Transactions”).

On June 2, 2020, in connection with the pricing of the 2027 Convertible Notes, Splunk entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “2027 Base Capped Call Transactions”) with Barclays Bank PLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, New York Branch, (the “2027 Capped Call Counterparties”). On June 4, 2020, in connection with the initial purchasers’ exercise of their option to purchase additional 2027 Convertible Notes, Splunk entered into additional capped call transactions with the 2027 Capped Call Counterparties (the “2027 Additional Capped Call Transactions” and, together with the 2027 Base Capped Call Transactions the “2027 Capped Call Transactions,” which, together with the 2025 Capped Call Transactions, constitute the “Capped Call Transactions”).

The Capped Call Transactions initially covered, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of Splunk common stock that initially underlie the Convertible Notes. The strike price of the 2025 Capped Call Transactions is $148.30 per share of Splunk common stock, and the cap price of the 2025 Capped Call Transactions is $232.62 per share of Splunk common stock, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 2025 Capped Call Transactions. The strike price of the 2027 Capped Call Transactions is $255.34 per share of Splunk common stock, and the cap price of the 2027 Capped Call Transactions is $378.28 per share of Splunk common stock, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 2027 Capped Call Transactions. The Capped Call Transactions were generally expected to reduce potential dilution to Splunk Stockholders upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset the potential cash payments that Splunk could be required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted Convertible Notes upon conversion thereof, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price.

The Capped Call Counterparties may adjust certain terms of the Capped Call Transactions in connection with the announcement of the Merger, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated, pursuant to the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. In addition, Splunk expect that the Capped Call Transactions will be terminated in connection with the closing of the Merger.

Management Projections

Summary of Management Projections

Other than providing near term financial guidance in connection with its ordinary course earnings announcements, Splunk does not typically provide public forecasts, projections, estimates or predictions of its future earnings, income or other financial results due to the inherent unpredictability of such financial results and variability in the underlying assumptions necessary to forecast, project, estimate and predict future financial results, especially over longer periods of time. In connection with the Merger, however, at the direction of the Board of Directors, Splunk’s management prepared projections of Splunk’s financial results for the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year 2024, as well as its fiscal years 2025 and 2026. In addition, in order to facilitate the financial analyses of the Merger by Splunk’s financial advisors, Splunk’s management prepared projections of Splunk’s financial results for fiscal years 2027 through 2034 by extrapolating from the foregoing financial projections. We refer to these projections, including the extrapolations, as the “Baseline Management Projections.” At the direction of the Board of Directors, Splunk’s management also prepared two additional sets of alternative long-term financial projections covering the same forecast period covered in the Baseline Management Projections, which are referred to in this section as the “Sensitivity 1 Projections” and the “Sensitivity 2 Projections,” respectively, in order to give the Board of Directors a broader perspective on possible alternative financial outcomes if macroeconomic factors caused growth rates to slow over time (the “Sensitivity 1 Projections” and the “Sensitivity 2 Projections,” together with the Baseline Management Projections, the “Management Projections”).

Splunk is including below a summary of the Management Projections in order to provide Splunk Stockholders with access to information that was made available to, and approved by, the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger. The Management Projections were also reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors

for use and reliance by Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley in connection with each financial advisor’s respective financial analyses and opinion delivered to the Board of Directors as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Opinions of Qatalyst Partners LP and Morgan Stanley & Co.

(1)“Non-GAAP Operating Income” a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by starting with GAAP operating income (loss) and adjusting to exclude stock-based compensation and related employer payroll tax, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related adjustments, restructuring and facility exit charges, and capitalized software development costs.

(2)“Unlevered Free Cash Flow” is Non-GAAP Operating Income plus (1) depreciation and amortization expense, (2) increases in deferred revenue, and (3) amortization of deferred commissions, less (1) cash taxes, (2) capital expenditures, (3) capitalized deferred commissions, and plus or minus changes in net working capital (excluding deferred revenue).

Important Information Regarding the Management Projections

The Management Projections were developed by Splunk management on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, the Management Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the Merger to be completed and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. Although the Management Projections are presented with numerical specificity, they were based on numerous variables and assumptions made by Splunk management with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to Splunk’s business, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond Splunk’s control. The Management Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results forecasted in the Management Projections, including, but not limited to, general business and economic conditions, conditions in the industries and businesses in which Splunk operates, Splunk’s business and financial performance, customer requirements, staffing levels, competition, adverse changes in applicable laws, regulations or rules, the ability to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions, and the various risks set forth in Splunk’s periodic reports filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than the Management Projections. The Management Projections cover

numerous years, and such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. In addition, the Management Projections will be affected by Splunk’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The Management Projections reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and cannot, therefore, be considered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be relied on as such. The inclusion of the Management Projections herein should not be regarded as an indication that Splunk, Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley, their respective directors, officers, affiliates, advisors, or other representatives or anyone who received this information then considered, or now considers, them a reliable prediction of future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. The inclusion of the Management Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Management Projections will be necessarily predictive of actual future events. No representation is made by Splunk or any other person regarding the Management Projections or Splunk’s ultimate performance compared to such information. The Management Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information about Splunk contained in Splunk’s public filings with the SEC. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Where You Can Find More Information.” In light of the foregoing factors, and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Projections, Splunk Stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management Projections.

The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information. The Management Projections included in this document have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Splunk's management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying Management Projections and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Splunk’s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the Management Projections and should not be read to do so.

Non-GAAP Operating Income and Unlevered Free Cash Flow contained in the Management Projections summarized above are “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the Management Projections were relied upon by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and, at the direction of the Board of Directors, by Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley for purposes of each financial advisor’s respective financial analyses and opinion delivered to the Board of Directors. The SEC rules which would otherwise require a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to a GAAP financial measure do not apply to non-GAAP financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination such as the Merger if the disclosure is included in a document such as this proxy statement. In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures were not relied upon by the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger or by either Qatalyst Partners or Morgan Stanley for purposes of such financial advisor’s respective opinion delivered to the Board of Directors. Accordingly, Splunk has not provided a reconciliation of the financial measures included in the Management Projections to the relevant GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Splunk may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The summary of the Management Projections above is included herein solely to give Splunk Stockholders access to the information that was made available to the Board of Directors, Qatalyst Partners and Morgan Stanley, as well as Parent (who was provided a subset of the Management Projections), in connection with the Merger and is not included in this proxy statement in order to influence any Splunk Stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the Merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to their shares of Splunk common stock in connection with the Merger. In addition, the Management Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date they were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable securities laws, Splunk does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Management Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error.

Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger

In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that Splunk Stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, Splunk Stockholders should be aware that Splunk’s executive officers and non-employee directors have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Splunk Stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Splunk Stockholders.

Certain Assumptions

Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following assumptions were used:

•The Effective Time is October 15, 2023, which is the assumed date of the Closing solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section;

•Each executive officer of Splunk experiences a qualifying termination of employment (i.e., a termination of employment by Splunk and/or Parent without “cause” or by the executive officer for “good reason,” as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and agreements) immediately following the assumed Effective Time of October 15, 2023;

•The performance metrics applicable to Company PSUs granted in and after our fiscal year 2023 will have been achieved at the maximum level of performance, and the stock price metrics applicable to Company PSUs granted prior to our fiscal year 2023 will not have been achieved;

•The potential payments and benefits described in this section are not at a level subject to a “cutback” to avoid the “golden parachute” excise tax that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Code; and

•No director or executive officer receives any additional equity grants or other awards on or prior to the assumed Effective Time of October 15, 2023.

None of our executive officers or non-employee directors hold Unvested Company Options or Unvested Company Shares. As the amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate as of the date referenced, the actual amounts, if any, that may be paid or become payable may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.

Treatment and Quantification of Company Equity Awards

Vested Company Equity Awards

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Vested Company RSU that is outstanding and has not yet been settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Vested Company PSU that is outstanding and has not yet been settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will terminate and be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable Cash-Out Amount from Parent for such Vested Company RSU or Vested Company PSU, less any applicable taxes.

For each Vested Company RSU, including each Company RSU held by a non-employee director, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Vested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

For each Vested Company PSU, including each Company PSU that vests effective as of the Effective Time based on attainment of the actual level of performance as determined prior to the Closing by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof in accordance solely with the terms of the applicable contract with the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Vested Company PSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Unvested Company Equity Awards

Unvested Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Unvested Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable Cash-Out Amount from Parent for such Unvested Company RSU (such amount, the “Unvested Cash (RSUs)”). Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, the Unvested Cash (RSUs) will vest and become payable at the same time as the Unvested Company RSU, as applicable, from which such resulting Unvested Cash (RSUs) was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and will otherwise remain subject to the same terms, conditions, restrictions and service-based vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company RSUs, as applicable, including those provisions for accelerated vesting on certain terminations of employment, in each case, as in effect from time to time unless otherwise superseded by any applicable contract between the holder thereof and Splunk or Parent or their respective affiliates, but effective from and after the Effective Time.

For each Unvested Company RSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Unvested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Unvested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Unvested Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable Cash-Out Amount from Parent for such Unvested Company PSU (the “Unvested Cash (PSUs)”). Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, the Unvested Cash (PSUs) will vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company PSU from which such Unvested Cash (PSUs) was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and will otherwise remain subject to the same terms, conditions, restrictions and service-based vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company PSUs, including those provisions for accelerated vesting on certain terminations of employment, in each case, as in effect from time to time unless otherwise superseded by any applicable contract between the holder thereof and Splunk or Parent or their respective affiliates, but effective from and after the Effective Time.

For each Unvested Company PSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Splunk common stock underlying such Company PSU based on the attainment of the applicable performance metrics at the actual level of performance through Closing as determined prior to the Closing by the Board of Directors or committee thereof in accordance solely with the terms applicable to such Unvested Company PSU, by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Quantification of Company Equity Awards

At the Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU (the only type of equity award held by the non-employee members of the Board of Directors) will convert into Per Share Merger Consideration in the manner described above. Based on the assumptions described above under the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger—Certain Assumptions,” the estimated aggregate amount that would become payable to Splunk’s ten (10) non-employee directors in respect of their Vested Company RSUs is $5,325,597, which excludes any grants of Company RSUs that may be made by Splunk to the non-employee directors following the date of this proxy statement.

At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company RSU and Unvested Company PSU held by Splunk’s executive officers will convert into unvested cash awards in the manner described above and will generally remain subject to the same time-based vesting conditions and other terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to and after giving effect to the Effective Time, except as described below under the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger—Compensation Arrangements with Parent.” Each unvested cash award will vest in the event that the executive officer experiences a termination of employment by Splunk and/or Parent without cause or by the executive officer for good reason, in either case, within six (6) months prior to the Effective Time or within eighteen (18) months following the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, and as a result of the attainment of the performance metrics applicable to Company PSUs at the actual level of performance, a portion of each Company PSU will become a Vested Company PSU and will be paid to the executive officers shortly following the Effective Time. With respect to the Company PSUs granted in our fiscal years 2023 and 2024, except as described below under the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger—Compensation Arrangements with Parent—Treatment of Mr. Steele’s Splunk Equity Awards,” (i) the applicable performance metrics will be determined by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the Company PSUs will correspondingly performance-vest, effective as of the Effective Time, (ii) a portion of the performance-vested Company PSUs will become Vested Company PSUs effective as of the Effective Time on a prorated basis (based on months of service in such performance period through such date), and (iii) the portion of the performance-vested Company PSUs that do not become Vested Company PSUs will remain Unvested Company PSUs as described above. Company PSUs granted prior to our fiscal year 2023 will not become Vested Company PSUs solely as a result of the Effective Time.

See the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” for an estimate of the amounts that would become payable to each Splunk named executive officer in respect of his Unvested Company RSUs, Unvested Company PSUs and Vested

Company PSUs. Based on the assumptions described above under the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger—Certain Assumptions,” the estimated aggregate amounts that would become payable to Splunk’s two current executive officers who are not named executive officers in respect of their Unvested Company RSUs is $26,411,325, Unvested Company PSUs is $30,025,465, and Vested Company PSUs is $15,605,957.

Potential Severance Payments Upon a Qualifying Termination Prior to or Following the Effective Time

Employment Agreements

Splunk maintains employment agreements with each of its current executive officers (the “Employment Agreements”). The Employment Agreements generally provide that if the executive officer is terminated by Splunk and/or Parent without cause or by the executive officer for good reason, in either case, within six (6) months prior to the Effective Time or within eighteen (18) months following the Effective Time, then the executive officer will receive:

•a lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of the executive officer’s then-current base salary (twenty-four (24) months, in the case of Mr.Steele), plus 100% of the executive officer’s annual target bonus for the year of termination (twenty-four (24) months of annual target bonus plus a pro-rated portion of the annual target bonus for the year of termination, in the case of Mr.Steele), less any amounts already paid for such year;

•payment of up to twelve (12) months of COBRA premiums to continue health insurance coverage for our executive officers and their eligible dependents (eighteen (18) months, in the case of Mr.Steele) or a lump sum payment of $24,000 ($36,000, in the case of Mr.Steele); and

•accelerated vesting of then-outstanding equity awards, as discussed above in “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger— Quantification of Company Equity Awards”.

Severance benefits are subject to the executive officer timely executing and not revoking a release of claims in favor of Splunk. The Employment Agreements further provide that if an executive officer receives any amount that is subject to the “golden parachute” excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, the amount of the payments to be made to the executive officer will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid imposition of the excise tax, but only if the after-tax amount of the reduced payments exceeds the after-tax amount that the executive officer would receive without any such reduction following imposition of the excise tax and all income and related taxes.

Messrs. Steele, Smith and Casey have entered into employment agreements with Parent providing for severance benefits, as described below under “—Compensation Arrangements with Parent.” See the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” for an estimate of the amounts that each of Splunk’s named executive officers would receive under their respective employment agreements upon a qualifying termination of employment. Based on the assumptions described above under “—Certain Assumptions”, the estimated aggregate amount of the cash severance payments to be provided to Splunk’s two executive officers who are not named executive officers under their employment agreements with Parent upon a qualifying termination of employment is $2,115,000.

FY25 Annual Bonus

To the extent the Effective Time occurs in Splunk’s fiscal year 2025 or prior to the payment of annual incentive bonuses in respect of fiscal year 2025, and if a continuing employee, including our executive officers, is terminated from employment following the Effective Time by Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) without cause, the continuing employee would receive a bonus for fiscal year 2025 of no less than the pro-rata portion of such annual bonus that such continuing employee would have been entitled to receive under the applicable annual incentive plan determined based on the level of achievement of the applicable performance criteria as of the Effective Time as determined by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof prior to the Effective Time, and pro-rated based on the number of days in the applicable portion of the performance period that have elapsed as of the Effective Time. As the Effective Time for purposes of this disclosure is assumed to be October 15, 2023, termination without cause protection for the pre-Closing portion of the fiscal year 2025 annual bonus will not be in effect.

FY26 Annual Bonus

To the extent the Effective Time occurs in Splunk’s fiscal year 2026 or prior to the payment of annual incentive bonuses in respect of fiscal year 2026, and if a continuing employee, including our executive officers, is terminated from

employment following the Effective Time by Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) without cause, the continuing employee would receive a bonus for fiscal year 2026 of no less than the pro-rata portion of such annual bonus that such continuing employee would have been entitled to receive under the applicable annual incentive plan determined based on the level of achievement of the applicable performance criteria as of the Effective Time as determined by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof prior to the Effective Time, and pro-rated based on the number of days in the applicable portion of the performance period that have elapsed as of the Effective Time. As the Effective Time for purposes of this disclosure is assumed to be October 15, 2023, termination without cause protection for the pre-Closing portion of the fiscal year 2026 annual bonus will not be in effect.

Retention Bonus

Splunk is permitted to provide Mr.Roberts with a cash retention bonus of $4,000,000. As of the date of this proxy statement, Mr.Roberts has not yet received the retention bonus.

280G Mitigation Actions

In connection with the Merger, Splunk may, subject to prior consultation with Parent, take certain tax-planning actions to mitigate any adverse tax consequences under the “golden parachute” provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code that could arise in connection with the completion of the Merger. The tax-planning and mitigation actions may include accelerating payments that would have vested and otherwise become payable in calendar year 2024 or later in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board of Directors or a committee thereof has not approved specific actions that it will take to mitigate the potential impact of the excise tax imposed on amounts that constitute “excess parachute payments” under Section 280G of the Code on any affected individuals (including Splunk’s executive officers).

Compensation Arrangements with Parent

On September 20, 2023, Parent entered into an at-will employment agreement with each of Messrs. Steele, Casey and Smith (collectively, the “Parent Employment Agreements”), setting forth the terms and conditions of these executives’ continued employment with Parent from and after Closing. The effectiveness of the Parent Employment Agreements is contingent on Closing. The chairman of our Board of Directors approved the retention of outside legal counsel to represent the executives in the Parent Employment Agreement negotiations.

The Parent Employment Agreements provide, following the Effective Time of the Merger, for (a) a base salary of $900,000, $575,000 and $600,000 for Messrs. Steele, Casey and Smith, respectively, (b) participation in Parent’s bonus plan, (c) payment of a cash retention bonus equal to (i) for Mr. Steele, $15,000,000, of which $5,000,000 will vest on the 12-month anniversary of Closing and the remainder will vest in quarterly installments over the immediately following twenty-four (24) months and (ii) for each of Messrs. Casey and Smith, $12,000,000, of which $2,400,000 will vest upon Closing and the remainder will vest in quarterly installments over a three-year period ending on the third anniversary of Closing, in each case, subject to continued employment on the applicable vesting date, (d) for each of Messrs. Casey and Smith, a one-time award of restricted stock units of Parent with a grant date value of $6,000,000, of which one-third will vest on the first anniversary of Closing and the remainder will vest in equal quarterly installments over the following two-year period ending on the third anniversary of Closing, subject to continued employment on the applicable vesting date, and (e) for Mr. Smith, payment of a cash bridging bonus of $120,000 for each of the next three years following his commencement of employment with Parent, subject to continued employment on the applicable payment date.

Treatment of Mr. Steele’s Splunk Equity Awards

Under Mr. Steele’s Parent Employment Agreement, (a) Mr. Steele’s Company RSUs that are converted into Unvested Cash (RSUs) shall be subject to the same vesting schedule as Mr. Steele’s corresponding Splunk RSUs, provided that all outstanding Unvested Cash (RSUs) shall vest and be paid on the first anniversary of Closing and (b) Mr. Steele’s Company PSUs that are converted into Unvested Cash (PSUs) will vest and be paid 50% on Closing and 50% on the first anniversary of Closing, in each case, subject to Mr. Steele’s continued employment through the applicable vesting date.

Termination Protections for Mr. Steele

Under Mr. Steele’s Parent Employment Agreement, (a) if Mr. Steele’s employment is terminated without cause, (b)if Mr. Steele resigns with good reason, (c) in the event of Mr. Steele’s death or permanent disability, or (d) if Mr.Steele voluntarily terminates active employment following the first anniversary of Closing (as such terms are defined in

Mr.Steele’s Parent Employment Agreement), in each case, within eighteen (18) months following Closing, then, subject to Mr. Steele’s execution of an effective release of claims, Mr. Steele will be entitled to receive (i) a cash amount as severance equal to the sum of (x) twenty-four (24) months of Mr. Steele’s monthly base salary, (y) two times 125% of Mr. Steele’s annual base salary, and (z) a pro-rated portion of Mr. Steele’s target annual bonus, (ii)the cost of COBRA coverage for eighteen (18) months, which amount will be grossed up to cover applicable taxes, and (iii) if such termination occurs within twelve (12) months following Closing, an amount equal to one-third of Mr.Steele’s retention bonus, as described above.

Under Mr. Steele’s Parent Employment Agreement, (a) if Mr. Steele’s employment is terminated without cause, (b)if Mr. Steele resigns with good reason, or (c) in the event of Mr. Steele’s death or permanent disability, then, subject to Mr. Steele’s execution of an effective release of claims, any Unvested Cash (RSUs) or Unvested Cash (PSUs) held by Mr. Steele will vest.

Termination Protections for Messrs. Casey and Smith

Under each of Messrs. Casey’s and Smith’s Parent Employment Agreement, (a) if an executive’s employment is terminated without cause, (b) if an executive resigns with good reason, or (c) in the event of an executive’s death or permanent disability (as such terms are defined in Messrs. Casey’s and Smith’s Parent Employment Agreement), in each case, within eighteen (18) months following Closing, then, subject to executive’s execution of an effective release of claims, such executive will be entitled to receive (i) a cash amount as severance equal to the sum of (x)twelve (12) months of executive’s monthly base salary, and (y) a target annual bonus for the year in which executive’s termination occurs, and (ii) the cost of COBRA coverage for twelve (12) months, which amount will be grossed up to cover applicable taxes.

Under each of Messrs. Casey’s and Smith’s Parent Employment Agreement, (a) if an executive’s employment is terminated without cause, (b) if an executive resigns with good reason, or (c) in the event of executive’s death or permanent disability, in each case, within thirty-six (36) months of Closing, then, subject to executive’s execution of an effective release of claims, any Unvested Cash (RSUs) or Unvested Cash (PSUs) held by such executive will vest.

Following Closing, the severance benefits set forth in the Parent Employment Agreements will supersede the severance benefits previously set forth in the executives’ Employment Agreements.

The Parent Employment Agreements require each executive to execute a non-competition agreement restricting the executive from competing with Parent and from soliciting employees of Parent, (a) with respect to Mr. Steele, until the second anniversary of Closing and (b) with respect to Messrs. Casey and Smith, during employment and for a period of twelve (12) months following termination of employment.

As of the date of this proxy statement, no other Splunk executive officers or any non-employee directors of Splunk have entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates. The Merger is not conditioned upon any executive officer or director of Splunk entering into any such agreement, arrangement or understanding. However, it is anticipated that some or all of the other Splunk executive officers may discuss or enter into agreements with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of its affiliates, effective as of the completion of the Merger.

Indemnification and Insurance

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Splunk’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage for a period of six (6) years following the effective time under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies from the surviving corporation. This indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance.”

Golden Parachute Compensation

The table below sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for each named executive officer of Splunk that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the Merger-related compensation payable to the named executive officers of Splunk.

The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table,

and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of the Merger transaction. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:

•The Effective Time is October 15, 2023, which is the assumed date of Closing solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section;

•Each named executive officer of Splunk experiences a qualifying termination of employment (i.e., a termination of employment by Splunk and/or Parent without “cause” or by the executive officer for “good reason,” as such terms are defined in the relevant plans and agreements) immediately following the assumed Effective Time of October 15, 2023;

•The performance metrics applicable to Company PSUs granted in and after our fiscal year 2023 will have been achieved at the maximum level of performance, and the stock price metrics applicable to Company PSUs granted prior to our fiscal year 2023 will not have been achieved;

•The potential payments and benefits described in this section are not at a level subject to a “cutback” to avoid the “golden parachute” excise tax that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Code; and

•No named executive officer receives any additional equity grants or other awards on or prior to the assumed Effective Time of October 15, 2023.

For purposes of this disclosure, Splunk’s named executive officers are: (i) Gary Steele, President and Chief Executive Officer; (ii) Graham Smith, former Interim Chief Executive Officer and current non-employee Chairman of the Board of Directors; (iii) Brian Roberts, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and (iv) Scott Morgan, Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, Global Affairs and Secretary.

Although the following individuals are considered named executive officers for purposes of this disclosure, none hold any unvested or outstanding Splunk equity awards or have any interests in the Merger except as they may be Splunk Stockholders: (i) Jason Child, the former Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Splunk, who terminated employment with Splunk effective as of November 1, 2022; (ii) Teresa Carlson, the former President and Chief Growth Officer of Splunk, who terminated employment with Splunk effective as of March 31, 2022; and (iii)Shawn Bice, the former President of Products and Technology of Splunk, who terminated employment with Splunk effective as of June 16, 2022.

Steele, Roberts and Morgan upon a termination of employment by Splunk and/or Parent without cause or by such named executive officer for good reason, in each case, pursuant to the named executive officer’s Employment Agreement (or, in the case of Mr. Steele after the Effective Time, his Parent Employment Agreement) and (ii) for Mr.Roberts, and to the extent Splunk provides him with the permitted cash retention bonus, his $4,000,000 retention bonus. The cash severance payable to Messrs. Steele, Roberts and Morgan are “double-trigger” payments, which means that the amounts will become payable only upon a qualifying termination of employment within six (6) months prior to and eighteen (18) months following Closing. The portion of the retention bonus under Mr. Steele’s Parent Employment Agreement included in this disclosure is “double-trigger” in nature in that it becomes payable to him by Parent upon a termination of employment within twelve (12) months following Closing. The retention bonus that may become payable to Mr.Roberts is deemed to be “single-trigger” in nature in that it is being paid to him by Splunk in connection with the transaction. Mr.Smith does not have any entitlement to any transaction-related cash compensation. For further details regarding the cash severance and the retention bonus that may become payable to Splunk’s named executive officers, see “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger—Employment Agreements,” “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger—Retention Bonus” and “—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger—Compensation Arrangements with Parent.” The estimated amount of each such payment is shown in the following table:

The accelerated vesting of those Company PSUs that become Vested Company PSUs in accordance with their terms (or, in the case of Mr. Steele after the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of his Parent Employment Agreement) and in connection with the Effective Time are “single-trigger” payments, which means that the amounts will vest and become payable solely as a result of continued employment through the Effective Time.

Financing of the Merger

Parent and Merger Sub have represented to Splunk that, as of September 20, 2023, they had and will have available to them sufficient funds to make the payments required to be paid at the Effective Time by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement. This includes funds needed to: (1) pay Splunk Stockholders the amounts due under the Merger Agreement for their Splunk common stock and (2) make payments in respect of outstanding Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs payable at the Effective Time pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by or to Parent or any of its affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement.

Dissenters’ Rights

General

Under the DGCL, Splunk Stockholders have the right to demand appraisal and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their shares of Splunk common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in lieu of the Per Share Merger Consideration,

71

subject to the requirements and limitations set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL described herein. These rights are known as appraisal rights. Splunk Stockholders of record and beneficial owners electing to exercise appraisal rights must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in order to perfect their rights. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures is required to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.

This section is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of Delaware law pertaining to appraisal rights. The following discussion, however, is not a complete summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. Failure to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. The following discussion does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not a Splunk Stockholder of record or beneficial owner should exercise his, her or its right to seek appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL.

Subject to certain exceptions specified in Section 262 of the DGCL and summarized below, holders of record, and beneficial owners, of shares of Splunk common stock who: (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such Person’s shares to Splunk prior to the vote on the Merger Agreement; (2) have not consented to or otherwise voted in favor of the Merger Agreement or otherwise withdrawn, lost or waived appraisal rights; (3) continuously are the record holders or beneficial holders, as applicable, of such shares through the Effective Time; and (4) otherwise comply with the applicable procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of such shares (as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) as of the completion of the Merger instead of the Per Share Merger Consideration. Any such Splunk Stockholder of record or beneficial holder awarded “fair value” for the holder’s shares by the court would receive payment of that fair value in cash, together with interest, if any, in lieu of the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. It is possible that any such “fair value” as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more or less than, or the same as the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Section 262 of the DGCL requires that Splunk Stockholders for whom appraisal rights are available be notified not less than 20 days before the Special Meeting. Either a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL or information directing Splunk Stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost must be included with such notice. This Proxy Statement constitutes our notice to the Splunk Stockholders of the availability of appraisal rights in connection with the Merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. Splunk Stockholders of record and beneficial owners who wish to exercise appraisal rights or who wish to preserve the right to do so should review the following summary and the applicable statutory provisions carefully. Failure to comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Splunk unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the Splunk Stockholders of record and beneficial owners seeking appraisal. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, Splunk Stockholders of record and beneficial owners who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their own legal and financial advisors in connection with compliance under Section 262 of the DGCL. A Splunk Stockholder of record or beneficial owner who loses, waives or otherwise fails to properly exercise his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights

If you are a Splunk Stockholder of record or a beneficial holder and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares of Splunk common stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:

•You must deliver to Splunk a written demand for appraisal before the vote on approval of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the Merger Agreement. Voting against or failing to vote for the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the Splunk Stockholder of record or beneficial holder and the intention of such holder to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. A failure by such holder to make a written demand for appraisal before the vote with respect to the Merger Agreement is taken will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

•In the case of a Splunk Stockholder of record, you must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the Merger Agreement. A vote in favor of the Merger Agreement, by proxy submitted by mail, over the Internet or by telephone, will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for appraisal. A proxy which does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Agreement. Therefore, a Splunk Stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must instruct the proxy to vote against the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the Merger Agreement. In the case of a beneficial owner, you must not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your share(s), or abstain from voting, in favor of the Merger Agreement;

•You must continuously hold or beneficially own, as applicable, shares of Splunk common stock from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer the shares before the Effective Time; and

•You must otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, including the requirement that you, another Company Stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 or Splunk must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. Splunk is under no obligation to file any petition and has no present intention of doing so.

If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Splunk common stock.

In addition, because shares of Splunk common stock are listed on a national securities exchange and is expected to continue to be listed on such exchange immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all shares of Splunk common stock, unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Splunk common stock eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration for such total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million (collectively, the “Ownership Thresholds”). At least one of the Ownership Thresholds must be met in order for Splunk Stockholders to be entitled to seek appraisal with respect to such shares of Splunk common stock.

In the case of a record holder of shares of Splunk common stock, voting, via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the Merger Agreement will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal is in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote. If you want to exercise your appraisal rights, you must not vote your shares of Splunk common stock via the Internet during the Special Meeting or by proxy in favor of the Merger Agreement.

In the case of a beneficial owner of shares of Splunk common stock, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares in “street name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote those shares on the Merger Agreement without specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner on such proposal, but such brokers, banks or other nominees will vote such shares as instructed if the beneficial owner provides such instructions. If a beneficial owner of shares of Splunk common stock held in “street name” instructs such person’s broker, bank or other nominee to vote such person’s shares in favor of the Merger Agreement, and does not revoke such instruction prior to the vote on the Merger Agreement, then such shares will be voted in favor of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of such beneficial owner’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, if you are a beneficial owner of shares of Splunk common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, you must either not provide any instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the Merger Agreement or instruct such broker, bank or other nominee to vote against the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on such proposal.

Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights

A holder of record or beneficial owner of shares of Splunk common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time may assert appraisal rights for the shares of Splunk common stock held of record or beneficially in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the Splunk Stockholder of record or beneficial owner, as applicable, and must reasonably inform Splunk of the identity of the Splunk Stockholder of record or beneficial owner and that the Splunk Stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares of Splunk common stock. In addition, in the case of a demand for appraisal made by a beneficial owner, the demand

must (1) reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (2) provide documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be and (3) provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by Splunk and to be set forth on the verified list of persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares pursuant to Section 262(f) of the DGCL. A holder of record, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, who holds shares of Splunk common stock as a nominee or intermediary for others, may exercise his, her or its right of appraisal with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of the holder of record.

If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand to:

Litigation Relating to the Merger

Following the announcement of the proposed transaction, Splunk received demands on behalf of purported stockholders alleging that the proxy statement filed in connection with the Merger between Splunk and Parent omitted certain purportedly material information regarding Splunk’s financial projections and Qatalyst Partners’ and Morgan Stanley’s financial analyses. Each demand requests corrective disclosures in advance of the Special Meeting. Splunk believes the demands are without merit. It is possible additional demands may be sent or lawsuits may be filed between the date of this proxy statement and consummation of the Merger.

Accounting Treatment

The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination, using the acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations. Parent will record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from Splunk, at their respective estimated fair values at the date of completion of the acquisition.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following is a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to Splunk Stockholders that are U.S. Holders whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of Splunk common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). This discussion assumes that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement and as described in this proxy statement.

This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, nor does it address any consequences to holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as:

•banks and other financial institutions;

•insurance companies;

•brokers or dealers in securities;

•traders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting;

•regulated investment companies;

•real estate investment trusts;

•tax-exempt entities or governmental organizations;

•mutual funds;

•holders who hold their shares of Splunk common stock as part of a “straddle,” hedge, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions;

•holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

•partnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “S corporations,” or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such entities);

•persons subject to the minimum tax;

•U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

•persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to Splunk common stock being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” as defined in Section 451(b) of the Code;

•holders of options granted under any Splunk benefit plan;

•holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of Splunk common stock (by vote or value); and

•holders that received their shares of Splunk common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options, through a tax-qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation.

This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax consequences other than those pertaining to the income tax (such as estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences) or any state, local or non-U.S. income or non-income tax consequences, or the consequences of the Medicare tax on net investment income. If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of Splunk common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of Splunk common stock and partners therein should consult their own tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger to their particular circumstances.

No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger described herein. This summary is not binding on the IRS or a court, and there can be no assurance that the tax consequences described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or that they would be sustained by a court if so challenged.

The following discussion does not address the tax consequences of any transactions effectuated before, after or at the same time as the Merger, whether or not in connection with the Merger, including, without limitation, the tax consequences to holders of options, warrants or similar rights to purchase shares of Splunk common stock.

THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAX LAWS.

U.S. Holders

This section applies to “U.S. Holders.” For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of Splunk common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

•an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

•a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

•an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

•a trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Splunk common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Splunk common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of Splunk common stock. Capital gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates that are applicable to long-term capital gains if the U.S. Holder has held its Splunk common stock for more than one year as of the effective date of the Merger. Capital gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be short-term capital gains (and taxed at ordinary income tax rates) if such U.S. Holder has held its Splunk common stock for one year or less as of the date of the Merger. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of Splunk common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its tax basis and holding period separately for each block of Splunk common stock.

SPLUNK STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAX LAWS.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

General

Splunk and Parent have agreed to use its respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents, waiting period expirations or terminations, waivers and approvals required to be obtained by it to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals include approval under the HSR Act and certain other applicable antitrust and foreign investment laws.

In addition, each of Splunk and Parent have agreed, to the extent permitted by applicable legal requirements, to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any such filing and related submissions and presentations, (ii) coordinate with one another in preparing and exchanging such materials, (iii) keep the other party reasonably informed of the status of matters related to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (iv) promptly provide one another (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such party to any applicable governmental entity. Further, Parent and Splunk have agreed that no party will independently participate in any substantive meeting (including telephonically) with a governmental entity without first giving the other party notice of the meeting and, to the extent practicable and permitted by law and the governmental entity, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to these and certain other limitations, Parent shall control the strategy related to obtaining and/or satisfying all such applicable consents, waiting period expirations or terminations, waivers and approvals.

To the extent necessary to obtain such regulatory approvals, Parent will timely make proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to orders providing for (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Parent or Splunk or any of their respective affiliates, (B) the termination of existing relationships, contractual rights, or obligations of Parent or Splunk or any of their respective affiliates, other than in respect of foreign investment laws or (C) the termination of any venture or other arrangement of Parent or Splunk or any of their respective affiliates, other than in respect of foreign investment laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent will not be required to propose, execute, carry out or agree or submit to any action or remedy that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, (i) a material impact on the Splunk business or Splunk and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) a material impact on the benefits expected to be derived by Parent or its affiliates from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or (iii) a material impact on any business or product line of Parent or its affiliates (other than Splunk and its subsidiaries). Further, Parent and Splunk will, to the extent necessary to obtain the applicable regulatory approvals, engage in litigation to contest or resist any action instituted (or threatened to be

instituted) challenging the Merger as in violation of any antitrust law, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, limits or restricts consummation of the Merger, including by appeal of any adverse ruling.

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters

Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until Splunk and Parent each files a Notification and Report Form with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act notification and report forms. If the FTC or DOJ issues a request for additional information and documents (which we refer to as a “Second Request”) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree to extend the waiting period.

Splunk and Parent each filed a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger with the FTC and DOJ on October 12, 2023. The HSR waiting period is expected to expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time on November 13, 2023.

At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC, the DOJ or any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or seeking to require the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.

Other Regulatory Approvals

The Merger is also subject to clearance or approval under certain other antitrust regimes, including in the European Union. The Merger cannot be completed until all applicable waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) applicable to the Merger under the antitrust laws in the relevant jurisdictions have expired or otherwise been terminated, or all requisite clearances, consents and approvals pursuant thereto have been obtained.

The Merger is subject to the expiration or otherwise termination of the applicable review periods (and any extensions) under, or the receipt of approvals, clearances, consents and approvals under, the relevant foreign investment laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, relevant regulatory bodies could take action under other applicable regulatory laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin or otherwise prevent the completion of the Merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under regulatory laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger on regulatory grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (i) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (ii) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (iii) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Splunk, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Splunk, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Splunk, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Splunk, Parent and Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding Splunk, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Splunk and our business.

Merger Consideration

Splunk Common Stock

At the Effective Time, and without any action required by any Splunk Stockholder, each share of Splunk common stock (other than Excluded Shares, which include, for example, shares of Splunk common stock owned by Splunk Stockholders who have properly exercised and not withdrawn their statutory rights of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished, and automatically converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding taxes.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards

The Merger Agreement provides that Company Equity Awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be subject to the following treatment:

Vested Company Equity Awards

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Vested Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU that is outstanding and has not yet been settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Vested Company PSU that is outstanding and has not yet been settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will terminate and be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable “Cash-Out Amount” from Parent for such Vested Company Option, Vested Company RSU or Vested Company PSU, less any applicable withholding taxes.

For each Vested Company Option, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock subject to such Vested Company Option by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration less the exercise price per share of such Vested Company Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided, that if the exercise price per share of such Vested Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Cash-Out Amount for such Vested Company Option will be zero).

For each Vested Company RSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock issuable upon settlement of such Vested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

For each Vested Company PSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock issuable upon settlement of such Vested Company PSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Unvested Company Equity Awards

Unvested Company Shares. At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Share will remain subject to the same restrictions, vesting arrangements or repurchase rights that were applicable to such Unvested Company Shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time, and will become payable by Parent on the date that such unvested Company share would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time, and will otherwise remain subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying unvested Company share immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each outstanding repurchase right will be assigned to Parent in the Merger and will thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and subject to the same conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, Unvested Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Unvested Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable “Cash-Out Amount” from Parent for such Unvested Company Option or Unvested Company RSU (the “Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs)”). Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, the Unvested Cash

(Options/RSUs) will vest and become payable at the same time as the Unvested Company Option or Unvested Company RSU, as applicable, from which such resulting Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and will otherwise remain subject to the same terms, conditions, restrictions and service-based vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company Options or Unvested Company RSUs, as applicable, including those provisions for accelerated vesting on certain terminations of employment, in each case, as in effect from time to time unless otherwise superseded by any applicable contract between the holder thereof and Splunk or Parent or their respective affiliates, but effective from and after the Effective Time.

For each Unvested Company Option, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock subject to such Unvested Company Option by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration less the exercise price per share of such Unvested Company Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided, that if the exercise price per share of such Unvested Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Cash-Out Amount for such Unvested Company Option will be zero).

For each Unvested Company RSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Splunk common stock issuable upon settlement of such Unvested Company RSU by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Unvested Company PSUs. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Unvested Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable “Cash-Out Amount” from Parent for such Unvested Company PSU (the “Unvested Cash (PSUs)”). Subject to the holder’s continued service with Parent and its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates, the Unvested Cash (PSUs) will vest and be payable at the same time as the Unvested Company PSU from which such Unvested Cash (PSUs) was converted would have vested and been payable pursuant to its terms and will otherwise remain subject to the same terms, conditions, restrictions and service-based vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company PSUs, including those provisions for accelerated vesting on certain terminations of employment, as in effect from time to time unless otherwise superseded by any applicable contract between the holder thereof and Splunk or Parent or their respective affiliates, but effective from and after the Effective Time.

For each Unvested Company PSU, the Cash-Out Amount will be determined by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Splunk common stock underlying such Unvested Company PSU (assuming conversion of performance-based vesting to service-based vesting and satisfaction of such service-based vesting and based on the attainment of the applicable performance metrics at the actual level of performance through Closing as determined prior to the Closing by the Board of Directors or committee thereof in accordance solely with the terms applicable to such Unvested Company PSU), by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Treatment of Company ESPP

The Merger Agreement provides that, with respect to the Company ESPP, as soon as practicable following the Agreement Date, Splunk will take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP that are necessary to provide that: (i) with respect to any Current ESPP Offering Period, no employee who is not a participant in the Company ESPP as of September 20, 2023 may become a participant in the Company ESPP and no participant may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect on September 20, 2023 for such Current ESPP Offering Period, (ii) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP will terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) if all such Current ESPP Offering Periods terminate prior to the Effective Time, then the Company ESPP will be suspended, (iv) no new Offering Period will be commenced under the Company ESPP prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement and (v) if any Current ESPP Offering Period is still in effect at the Effective Time, then the last day of such Current ESPP Offering Period will be accelerated to the Business Day prior to the Closing Date and the final settlement or purchase of shares of Splunk common stock thereunder shall be made on that day. Splunk shall provide all required notices of the foregoing to the participants in accordance with the Company ESPP.

Exchange and Payment Procedures

Computershare Inc. (or such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent as reasonably acceptable to Splunk) shall act as exchange agent (the “Exchange Agent”) to make payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration to Splunk Stockholders. At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to Splunk Stockholders.

As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) business days), the Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates representing outstanding shares of Splunk common stock (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) a letter of transmittal in customary form and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such holder’s shares of Splunk common stock represented by such holder’s certificate(s). Upon the Exchange Agent’s receipt of such letter of transmittal with respect to such certificated shares, or receipt of an appropriate “agent’s message” in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) with respect to any book-entry shares of Splunk common stock, such holder will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check for the cash amount of the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of such shares. The amount of any Per Share Merger Consideration paid to Splunk Stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.

•approve any transaction, or any third-party becoming an “interested stockholder,” under Section 203 of the DGCL; or

In addition, Splunk has agreed, and cause its subsidiaries and direct its representatives, to (i) cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any persons conducted prior to or on the date of the Merger Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause any person (and such person’s representatives) with which Splunk has engaged in any such activities within the twelve (12) month period preceding the date of the Merger Agreement to promptly return or destroy all confidential information previously provided to such person (and such person’s representatives)

Notwithstanding these restrictions, Splunk and its subsidiaries are permitted to, waive any rights under any “standstill” or similar covenants in confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements entered into in connection with or applicable to an Acquisition Proposal to which Splunk or any of its subsidiaries is a party to allow a person to make, or amend, an Acquisition Proposal (or make any related communications).

Splunk shall advise Parent in writing as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt by Splunk and/or any of its subsidiaries (and/or to the knowledge of Splunk, by any Splunk representative) of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer that

constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any other notice that any person is planning to submit an Acquisition Proposal or (iv) any request for non-public information (including access to any of the properties, books or records of Splunk or any of its subsidiaries) that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall describe the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request and the identity of the person or group submitting any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request. Splunk shall keep Parent informed as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than forty-eight (48) hours after receipt) of the status of, and any material amendments or modifications or proposed material amendments or modifications to, any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request and any material correspondence or communications related thereto, and shall provide to Parent as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) a true, correct and complete copy of all written materials and information provided to Splunk, one of its subsidiaries or a Splunk representative in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request (including any material amendments or modifications or proposed material amendments or modifications), or a reasonable written summary thereof if such material or information is not written.

Notwithstanding these restrictions, if, at any time prior to the time that Splunk’s Stockholders approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement, Splunk or any of its representatives receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national standing) is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, Splunk may:

•enter into discussions with such person regarding such Acquisition Proposal; and

•deliver or make available to such person non-public information regarding Splunk and its subsidiaries.

However, prior to taking any of the actions listed above, Splunk must have complied with the following:

•none of Splunk, its subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives has violated the non-solicitation and related provisions contained in the Merger Agreement in any material respect;

•the Board of Directors must first conclude in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Splunk Stockholders under applicable laws;

•prior to making available to any such person any material non-public information, Splunk first shall have received from such person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement shall be provided to Parent, for informational purposes only, within forty-eight (48) hours of its execution); and

•prior to or contemporaneously with delivering or making available any such non-public information to such Person, Splunk shall have delivered or made available such non-public information to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not previously been delivered or made available by Splunk to Parent).

Splunk is not entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, negotiating with Parent in good faith over a four-(4)-business-day period in an effort to amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, so that such Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a “Superior Proposal” relative to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as amended pursuant to such negotiations.

If Splunk terminates the Merger Agreement for the purpose of entering into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal, Splunk must pay a $1,000,000,000 termination fee to Parent.

For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement:

“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means a customary confidentiality agreement (i) that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to Splunk than those contained in the confidentiality agreement entered into between Splunk and Parent, including with respect to the treatment of confidential information and the non-solicitation of Splunk’s employees and (ii) that does not include any provision for any exclusive right to negotiate with such person or having the effect of restricting Splunk from fulfilling its obligations under the Merger Agreement,

including under the non-solicitation and related provisions contained in the Merger Agreement;

provided
that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any direct or indirect “standstill” or similar covenant or other provision that would restrict the making, or amendment, of any Acquisition Proposal (and related communications) to Splunk or the Board of Directors.

“Acquisition Proposal” means any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Parent or Merger Sub) relating to any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the Merger) involving (i) any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or group, whether from Splunk or any other person(s), of securities representing more than 15% of the total outstanding voting power of Splunk after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any person or group that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such person or group beneficially owning more than 15% of the total outstanding voting power of Splunk after giving effect to the consummation of such tender or exchange offer; (ii) any direct or indirect purchase (including by way of a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction), license or other acquisition by any person or group of assets (including equity securities of any subsidiary of Splunk) constituting or accounting for more than 15% of the revenue, net income or consolidated assets of Splunk and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction involving Splunk (or any of its subsidiaries whose business accounts for more than 15% of the revenue, net income or consolidated assets of Splunk and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) in which the stockholders of Splunk (or such subsidiary) prior to such transaction will not own at least 85%, directly or indirectly, of the surviving company.

“Superior Proposal” means, with respect to Splunk, a bona fide written offer submitted after the Agreement Date by a person or group to acquire, directly or indirectly, (i) pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination (including by means of a tender offer followed by a back-end merger) beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of Splunk or (ii) 50% or more of the assets of Splunk, in each case, that the Board of Directors has concluded in its good faith judgment (following consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national standing), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial (including the financing terms thereof), regulatory, timing and other aspects of the offer, including conditions to consummation and the person making the offer, in each case deemed relevant by the Board of Directors (x) would be, if consummated, more favorable, from a financial point of view, to Splunk’s Stockholder (in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of the Merger Agreement (after giving effect to any adjustments to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal) and (y) is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed (as determined in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors).

•adopt, accept, approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or

•fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in this proxy statement.

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Splunk Stockholders, the Board of Directors may effect a Change of Recommendation if (i) Splunk has received a Superior Proposal or (ii) there has been an Intervening Event (as defined herein), in each case, that the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

provided
that such new notice of Superior Proposal shall in no event shorten the original four (4) business-day period);

Employee Benefits

The Merger Agreement provides that each employee of Splunk and its subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including Splunk and its subsidiaries) as of the Effective Time (such employees collectively, the “Continuing Employees”), will be provided with certain compensation and benefits protections and entitlements, as set forth in the confidential disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement.

The Merger Agreement further provides that, except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its other affiliates to, recognize the service of each Continuing Employee with Splunk or its affiliates before the Effective Time (to the same extent recognized by Splunk or its affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time) as if such service had been performed with Parent or its affiliates under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent or its affiliates that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time.

With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or its affiliates in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its other affiliates, to the extent permitted by the relevant welfare plan and consistent with such plans’ application to similarly situated employees of Parent or its affiliates who are not Continuing Employees, to (i) cause each such Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate in such plans to the extent that coverage pursuant to such plans replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Splunk employee plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their qualified dependents to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees and their qualified dependents under the welfare plans maintained by Splunk or its affiliates prior to the Effective Time.

The Merger Agreement further provides that Parent acknowledges and agrees that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of the Splunk employee plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the Splunk employee plans and compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with their terms. However, no provision of the Merger Agreement will require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any

subsidiary thereof to continue any Splunk employee plan or prohibit the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such plans in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable law. The Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause each outstanding award under the Company Long-Term Cash Award Plan to continue in accordance with its terms from and after the Effective Time.

The Merger Agreement further provides that, unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing, the Board of Directors, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, will adopt, and Splunk will deliver to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of, resolutions terminating any and all Splunk employee plans (i) intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (each, a “Company 401(k) Plan”) and (ii) that are flexible spending accounts for health and dependent care, in each case, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the date Splunk becomes a member of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent but contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In such event, prior to the Closing Date and thereafter (as applicable), Splunk and Parent will take any and all action as may be required, including amendments to a U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or one of its subsidiaries (each, a “Parent 401(k) Plan”), to permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) in cash or notes (representing plan loans from the Company 401(k) Plan) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account balance distributable to such Continuing Employee from such Company 401(k) Plan to the corresponding Parent 401(k) Plan. If the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated as described in the Merger Agreement, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in a Parent 401(k) Plan as soon as practicable on or following the Closing Date.

Efforts to Close the Merger

Indemnification and Insurance

Parent, Merger Sub and Splunk have agreed that all indemnification or other similar agreements between any current or former directors, officers or employees, on the one hand, and Splunk or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, will survive the Merger and remain in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time. Additionally, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents of Splunk and of any subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of Splunk or any of its subsidiaries.

In addition, Splunk will maintain for six (6) years after the Effective Date Splunk’s current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance with respect to acts or omissions prior to the Effective Date or, prior to the Effective Time, Splunk will purchase a six-(6)-year “tail” insurance policy on Splunk’s current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance on terms and conditions providing comparable coverage with respect to matters arising before the Effective Time;

provided
that the annual premium of maintaining such current policy or purchasing such “tail” policy will not exceed 300% of the last annual premium paid by Splunk, and if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds the maximum amount, Splunk, Parent, or the Surviving Corporation will only be required to obtain as much coverage as possible for such amount.

Parent has also agreed to pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnification obligations provided in the Merger Agreement in the event Parent is found to have been in breach.

Merger Agreement (including any party failing to take such actions as are required of it in order to consummate the Merger Agreement). Parent, Merger Sub and Splunk acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in the Merger Agreement: the non-breaching party will be entitled (in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, including monetary damages), to obtain (A) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (B) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.

Parent, Merger Sub and Splunk agree not to raise any objections to (i) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of the Merger Agreement by Splunk, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (ii) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

Amendment

The Voting and Support Agreement

On September 20, 2023, in connection with the Merger Agreement, Parent also entered into a Voting and Support Agreement with H&F and Splunk. As of the Record Date, H&F owns 12,799,822 shares of Splunk common stock, representing approximately 7.6% of the shares of Splunk common stock outstanding as of the Record Date. The Voting and Support Agreement provides H&F with certain registration rights pursuant to which, among other things, the Company has agreed to prepare and file a registration statement with the SEC as soon as practicable for purposes of registering the resale of any Registrable Securities (as defined in the Voting and Support Agreement). A copy of the Voting and Support Agreement is attached as Annex B and is incorporated herein by reference.

Pursuant to the Voting and Support Agreement, H&F has agreed, among other things, to (i) vote in favor of the proposal to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and (ii) vote against (x) any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions of Splunk’s obligations set forth in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” not being fulfilled and (y) any Acquisition Proposal, or any agreement, transaction or other matter that is intended to, or would reasonably be expected to, prevent, materially impede or interfere with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 2: THE SPLUNK COMPENSATION PROPOSAL

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Splunk is required to submit a proposal to Splunk Stockholders to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Splunk’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This compensation is summarized in the section captioned “The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger.” The Board of Directors encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement.

Accordingly, Splunk is asking you to approve the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Splunk approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis the compensation that will or may become payable to Splunk’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned ‘‘—The Merger—Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of Splunk in the Merger.”

The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and vote not to approve this Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Splunk. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on this Compensation Proposal.

Vote Required and Board of Directors Recommendation

Approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding shares of Splunk common stock representing a majority of the outstanding shares present at the Special Meeting in person or by proxy, provided a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is present, (i) a failure to vote in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal, (ii)abstentions will not be counted as votes “FOR” or “AGAINST” and will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal and (iii) broker “non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Shares of Splunk common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a Splunk Stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of Splunk common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 3: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”). If Splunk Stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from Splunk Stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

If the Merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of Splunk Stockholders. However, if the Merger is not completed, Splunk Stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.

) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to and in

accordance with

Section 1.9
, an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Cash Amount, without interest. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically be cancelled and no longer be deemed outstanding, and the holders thereof shall not have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Cash Amount, without interest, upon surrender of Certificates and/or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with

Section 1.9
.

(ii)

Unvested Company Shares
. The cash payment pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)(i)
in exchange for Unvested Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be subject to the same restrictions, vesting arrangements or Repurchase Rights that were applicable to such Unvested Company Shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time. Therefore, cash otherwise payable pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)(i)
in exchange for Unvested Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Unvested Cash (Shares)”) shall not be payable by Parent at the Effective Time, and shall instead become payable by Parent on the date that such Unvested Company Share would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time and shall otherwise remain subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the underlying Unvested Company Share immediately prior to the Effective Time;

provided
that if the vesting conditions and terms are not satisfied and vesting ceases at any point after the Effective Time, and a portion of the Unvested Cash (Shares) remains unvested (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting provisions applicable thereto), no cash payments shall be made in respect of such unvested portion of the Unvested Cash (Shares), except the repurchase price described below, with respect to such portion of the Unvested Cash (Shares) allocable to Unvested Company Shares. To the extent vested, Parent shall make, or in its discretion shall cause a paying agent authorized by Parent to administer such payments on Parent’s behalf to make, all such required payments to holders of Unvested Cash (Shares) no later than the end of the second completed payroll cycle of Parent following the date on which the corresponding Unvested Cash Shares would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such awards at the Effective Time and in no event later than two and one-half (2.5) months following the end of the calendar year in which the corresponding Unvested Cash Shares would have become vested (subject to other restrictions and other terms of such vesting schedule and giving effect to the applicable terms with respect to acceleration of vesting under any agreement (or form thereof) set forth on Schedule 2.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter). All amounts payable pursuant to this

Section 1.8(a)(ii)
shall be treated as payment in respect of the sale of such Unvested Company Shares, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, and shall be paid without interest. All outstanding Repurchase Rights shall be assigned to Parent in the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and subject to the same conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that Repurchase Rights may be exercised by Parent retaining the Unvested Cash (Shares) into which such Unvested Company Shares have been converted and paying to the former holder thereof the repurchase price in effect for each such share subject to such Repurchase Right immediately prior to the Effective Time. No Unvested Cash (Shares), or right thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than Parent, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any Liability of such Person, prior to the distribution to such Person of such Unvested Cash (Shares) in accordance with this Agreement.

(iii)

Vested Company Options, Vested Company RSUs and Vested Company PSUs
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent will not assume any Vested Company Option, Vested Company RSU or Vested Company PSU. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Vested Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Vested Company RSU that is outstanding and has not yet been settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Vested Company PSU that is outstanding and has not yet been settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall terminate and be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable Cash-Out Amount from Parent for such Vested Company Option, Vested Company RSU or Vested Company PSU;

provided
that the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from such Cash-Out Amount the amount of withholding for Taxes required to be deducted and withheld as a result of the Transactions. The Cash-Out Amount payable pursuant to this

Section 1.8(a)(iii)
shall be rounded down to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating Cash-Out Amounts for all Vested Company Options, Vested Company RSUs or Vested Company PSUs represented by a particular grant held by such Person.

The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay through the payroll of the Surviving Corporation (to the extent applicable) to each holder of a Vested Company Option, Vested Company RSU or Vested Company PSU the applicable Cash-Out Amount, within ten (10) Business Days following the Effective Time;

provided
that to the extent payment within such time or on such date would trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payments shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty.

(iv)

Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent will not assume the obligation to deliver shares with respect to any Unvested Company Option or any Unvested Company RSU. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Unvested Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Unvested Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable Cash-Out Amount from Parent for such Unvested Company Option or Unvested Company RSU in accordance with the terms of this

Section 1.8(a)(iv)
and subject to

Section 1.8(a)(vi)
(the “Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs)”).

(v)

Unvested Company PSUs
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent will not assume the obligation to deliver shares with respect to any Unvested Company PSU. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, each Unvested Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and represent the right to receive the applicable Cash-Out Amount from Parent for such Unvested Company PSU in accordance with the terms of this

Section 1.8(a)(v)
and subject to

Section 1.8(a)(vi) 
(the “Unvested Cash (PSUs)” and, together with the Unvested Cash (Shares) and the Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs), the “Unvested Cash”).

(vi)

Payment of Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and Unvested Cash (PSUs)
. The cash payment pursuant to (i)

 Section 1.8(a)(iv)
for Unvested Company Options and Unvested Company RSUs shall remain subject to the same terms, conditions, restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company Options or Unvested Company RSUs, including those provisions for accelerated vesting on certain terminations of employment and (ii)

 Section 1.8(a)(v)
for Unvested Company PSUs shall remain subject to the same terms, conditions, restrictions and service-based vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company PSUs, including those provisions for accelerated vesting on certain terminations of employment, in each case, as in effect from time to time unless otherwise superseded by any applicable Contract between the holder thereof and the Company or Parent or their respective Affiliates, but effective from and after the Effective Time;

provided
that any performance-based vesting conditions shall no longer apply from and after the Effective Time. Therefore, the Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and Unvested Cash (PSUs) shall not be payable by Parent at the Effective Time, and shall instead become payable by Parent on the date that such Unvested Company Option, Unvested Company RSU or Unvested Company PSUs would have become vested in accordance with their terms. To the extent vested, Parent shall make, or in its discretion shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make, all such required payments to holders of Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) and Unvested Cash (PSUs) no later than the end of the second completed payroll cycle following the date on which the corresponding Unvested Company Option, Unvested Company RSU and Unvested Company PSU would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such awards at the Effective Time and in no event later than two and one-half (2.5) months following the end of the calendar year in which the corresponding Unvested Company Option, Unvested Company RSU or Unvested Company PSU, would have become vested (subject to other restrictions and other terms of such vesting schedule and giving effect to the applicable terms with respect to acceleration of vesting under any agreement (or form thereof) set forth on Schedule 2.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter);

provided
that to the extent payment within such time or on such date would trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payments shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty. The Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) payable pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)(iv)
and Unvested Cash (PSUs) payable pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)(v)
on a given payment date shall be rounded down to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating Cash-Out Amounts for all Unvested Company Options, Unvested Company RSUs and Unvested Company PSUs represented by a particular grant previously held by such Person that would have vested on the relevant vesting date. No Unvested Cash (Options/RSUs) or Unvested Cash (PSUs), or right

(vii)

Certain Non-U.S. Tax Matters
. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to Company Options, Company PSUs, and Company RSUs held by individuals subject to Taxes imposed by the Laws of a country other than the United States, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in good faith prior to the Effective Time to consider alternatives to minimize the Tax impact of the provisions set forth in this

Section 1.8(a)
, to include cooperating in good faith to apply for a revenue ruling or determination from a Governmental Entity on behalf of Parent or the Company, as applicable, to address such Tax impact (it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub need not take, and the Company shall not take, any action which would increase the costs (or accelerate the timing of payment) associated with the treatment set forth in this

Section 1.8(a)
).

(b)

Capital Stock of Merger Sub
. At the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub capital stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving Corporation’s capital stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time). The certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub common stock will evidence ownership of the same number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(c)

Cancellation of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company and Parent
. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each share of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled without any conversion thereof.

(d)

Adjustments
. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Capital Stock occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to specified numbers of shares of any class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties hereto the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like change.

(e)

Appraisal Rights
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if required by Delaware Law (but only to the extent required thereby), any shares of Company Common Stock held by any stockholder of the Company who has (i) neither voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and (ii) properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law (the “Dissenting Company Shares”), will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the merger consideration pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)
and instead will entitle the holders thereof to such rights as are granted to such holders by Section 262 of Delaware Law. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice and copies of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to the Company’s stockholders’ demands of appraisal and (ii) the right to participate in (but not direct) all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any demand for appraisal under Delaware Law, including any determination to make any payment to a holder of Dissenting Company Shares under Section 262(h) of Delaware Law prior to the entry of judgment in the Legal Proceedings with respect to any demand for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing in respect of any Dissenting Shares. If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to seek appraisal rights, the Dissenting Shares,

pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law, will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the merger consideration pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)

Surrender of Certificates
.

(a)

Exchange Agent
. Parent’s transfer agent, Computershare Inc. (or such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company), shall act as exchange agent (the “Exchange Agent”) in the Merger.

(b)

Parent to Deposit Cash
. At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary of Parent to, deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this

Article I
the cash payable pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)(i)
and

Section 1.8(a)(iii)
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes the Unvested Cash) (

provided
that the cash payable pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)(iii)
may instead be paid directly by either Parent through its payroll provider or, if so directed by Parent, by the Surviving Corporation through its payroll provider and to the extent payment would trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payments shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty).

(c)

Exchange Procedures
. Promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) following the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (“Certificates”) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use of such letter of transmittal in effecting surrender of Certificates in exchange for the cash payable pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)
. Each holder of record of book-entry shares (“Uncertificated Shares”) shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the cash payable pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)
. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Uncertificated Shares may provide an “agent’s message” in customary form with respect to any Uncertificated Share (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, or upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an appropriate agent’s message (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, each holder of such Certificate or such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check for the cash amount that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)
in respect of the Company Capital Stock represented by such Certificate or such Uncertificated Shares (which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes any Unvested Cash), and the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive cash pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)
, except as provided in

Section 1.8(e)
.

(d)

No Interest
. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)
or otherwise in connection with the Merger.

(e)

Transfers of Ownership
. If any cash amount payable pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)
is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall, as applicable, be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of cash in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(f)

No Liability
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

Section 1.9
, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Legal Requirement.

(g)

Unclaimed Cash
. Any portion of funds held by the Exchange Agent that has not been delivered to any holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this

Article I
within 12 months after the Effective Time shall promptly be paid to Parent, and thereafter each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares who has not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures set forth in and contemplated by

Section 1.9(c)
shall look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) for its claim, only as a general unsecured creditor thereof, to the cash payable to such holder pursuant to

Section 1.8(a)
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any Certificate or Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which the merger consideration contemplated by

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company in its sole discretion elects, by giving written notice to Parent at least two(2)Business Days prior to the Effective Time, in lieu of the foregoing insurance, the Company may purchase a comparable “tail” or “runoff” extension to the Existing D&O Policy for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time for a premium not to exceed the Maximum Premium.

Section 5.13

Assignment
. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment or delegation without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that Parent may make such assignment or delegation to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent without the prior consent of any other party hereto;

Severability

Schedule A
hereto (each, a “Stockholder”) and Splunk Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”).

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Spirit Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), which provides, among other things, for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the respective meanings specified in the Merger Agreement);

WHEREAS, each Stockholder beneficially owns the number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”) set forth opposite such Stockholder’s name on

Schedule A
hereto (such shares of Company Common Stock, the “Existing Shares”); and

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement and as an inducement and in consideration therefor, each Stockholder is entering into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

Section 1.1
, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of each Stockholder to vote (including by proxy or written consent, if applicable), in such Stockholder’s sole discretion, in favor of, against or abstain with

respect to any other matters that are, at any time or from time to time, presented for consideration to the Company’s stockholders.

Section 1.2

Restrictions on Transfers
.

(a) Subject to Section 1.5, absent the prior written consent of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld or conditioned, each Stockholder hereby agrees that, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (x) the Expiration Date and (y) the date on which the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, such Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, assign, tender in any tender or exchange offer, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or similarly dispose of (by merger, by testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise) (each, a “Transfer”), either voluntarily or involuntarily, or enter into any swap, contract, option or other arrangement or understanding providing for the Transfer of, any rights, including economic consequences, arising from any shares of Company Common Stock (whether New Shares or Existing Shares) or agree to do any of the foregoing, other than any Permitted Transfer to a Permitted Transferee, but only if prior (and as a condition) to the effectiveness of such Transfer:

(i) such Stockholder shall have given reasonable advance notice of such Transfer to Parent and the proposed form of written undertaking by the transferee to be bound by this Agreement and all obligations hereunder as if such transferee were a Stockholder and otherwise to become a party to this Agreement for all purposes hereunder, in each case, solely in respect of the Shares to be Transferred in accordance herewith;

(ii) such form of undertaking shall be reasonably satisfactory in all material respects to Parent; and

(iii) the transferee shall have executed and delivered, for the benefit of Parent, such undertaking to be bound by this Agreement and all obligations hereunder as if such transferee were such Stockholder and otherwise to become a party to this Agreement for all purposes hereunder, in each case, solely in respect of the Shares to be Transferred in accordance herewith.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this

Section 1.2
, a Transfer shall not include any ordinary course Transfers by limited partners of any equity interests of any investment funds advised by Hellman & Friedman Advisors, LLC (each such fund, “H&F”) not formed for the sole purposes of holding the shares of Company Common Stock, in and of themselves, so long as any such Transfer does not have any adverse effect on the ability of the applicable Stockholder to perform its obligations under this Agreement on the terms set forth herein.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) no provision in this Agreement shall restrict a Stockholder from effecting any Transfer of Shares following the date on which the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, and any Shares so Transferred to any person other than a Stockholder shall no longer constitute Shares subject to the provisions hereof and (ii) in no event shall the filing or effectiveness of a Registration Statement with respect to the Shares in and of itself be deemed a Transfer in violation of this Agreement.

(d) As used in this Agreement, “Permitted Transfer” shall mean, in each case, with respect to each Stockholder, any Transfer of Shares by such Stockholder (i) to another Stockholder, (ii) if the Stockholder is a natural person (A) to any member of such Stockholder’s immediate family, (B) to a trust whose sole beneficiaries are such Stockholder and/or members of such Stockholder’s immediate family, or (C) upon the death of such Stockholder, or (iii) to an Affiliate of such Stockholder (as applicable, each, a “Permitted Transferee”).

Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

Section 3.

Registration Limitations and Obligations
.

(a) Subject to Section 2, the Company will use reasonable efforts to prepare such supplements or amendments (including a post-effective amendment), if required by applicable law, to each applicable Registration Statement and file any other required document so that such Registration Statement will be Available at all times during the period for which such Registration Statement is, or is required pursuant to this Agreement to be, effective;

 provided
, that no such supplement, amendment or filing will be required during a Blackout Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled, from time to time, by providing written notice to the holders of Registrable Securities, to require such holders of Registrable Securities to suspend the use of the prospectus for sales of Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement during any Blackout Period;

 provided
, for purposes of this Section 3, the Company shall only be obligated to provide written notice to any holder or Beneficial Owner of Registrable Securities of any such Blackout Period if such holder or Beneficial Owner has specified in writing to the Company for purposes of receiving such notice such holder’s or Beneficial Owner’s address, contact and fax number information. No sales may be made under the applicable Registration Statement during any Blackout Period (with respect to clause (ii) of the definition thereof, of which the holders of Registrable Securities have or are deemed to have received notice). In the event of a Blackout Period under clause (ii) of the definition thereof, the Company shall (x) deliver to the holders of Registrable Securities a certificate signed by the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, general counsel or treasurer of the Company confirming that the conditions described in clause (ii) of the definition of Blackout Period are met, which certificate shall contain an approximation of the anticipated delay, and (y) notify each holder of Registrable Securities promptly upon each of the commencement and the termination of each Blackout Period, which notice of termination shall be delivered to each holder of Registrable Securities no later than the close of business of the last day of the Blackout Period. In connection with the expiration of any Blackout Period and without any further request from a holder of Registrable Securities, the Company to the extent necessary and as required by applicable law shall as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare supplements or amendments, including a post-effective amendment, to the Registration Statement or the prospectus, or any document incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required document so that the Registration Statement will be Available. A Blackout Period described in clause (ii) of the definition thereof shall be deemed to have expired when the Company has notified the holders of Registrable Securities that the Blackout Period is over and the Registration Statement is Available. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the absence of an Available Registration Statement at any time from and after the Registration Date shall be considered a Blackout Period described in clause (ii)of the definition thereof and subject to the limitations therein, except to the extent such absence occurs during (and does not extend beyond) a Blackout Period described in clause (i) of the definition thereof. For avoidance of doubt, upon expiration of a Blackout Period described in clause (i) of the definition thereof, any additional duration of a Blackout Period will be deemed to a Blackout Period described in clause (ii) of the definition thereof and subject to the limitations therein.

(b) At any time that a Registration Statement is effective and prior to the Registration Termination Date, if a holder of Registrable Securities delivers a notice to the Company (a “

Take-Down Notice
”) stating that it, together with any other holder of Registrable Securities, intend to sell at least $75,000,000 in aggregate of Registrable Securities held by such holder and such other holders (provided that, if the holders of Registrable Securities and their Affiliates do not collectively own at least $75,000,000 of Registrable Securities, they shall be permitted to deliver a Take-Down Notice to sell all of the Registrable Securities held by them (but such amount may not in any case be less than $25,000,000 collectively of Registrable Securities), in each case,

pursuant to the Registration Statement, then, the Company shall amend or supplement the Registration Statement as may be necessary and to the extent required by law so that the Registration Statement remains Available in order to enable such Registrable Securities to be distributed in an Underwritten Offering. In connection with any Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities for which a holder delivers a Take-Down Notice and satisfies the dollar thresholds set forth in first sentence above, and where the Take-Down Notice contemplates marketing efforts not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours by the Company and the underwriters, the Company will use reasonable efforts to cooperate and make its senior officers available for participation in such marketing efforts (which marketing efforts will not, for the avoidance of doubt, include a “road show” requiring such officers to travel outside of the city in which they are primarily located). The holder of Registrable Securities that delivered the applicable Take-Down Notice shall select the underwriter(s) for the Underwritten Offering;

provided
that the managing underwriter(s) (if there is only one underwriter, such underwriter shall be deemed to be the managing underwriter) shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Company shall select the counsel for the managing underwriter(s);

provided
that such counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the underwriter(s) and the holder of Registrable Securities that delivered the applicable Take-Down Notice. Such holder shall determine the pricing of the Registrable Securities offered pursuant to any such Registration Statement, including the underwriting discount and fees payable by such holder to the underwriters in such Underwritten Offering. Such holder shall reasonably determine the timing of any such registration and sale. Such holder shall determine the applicable underwriting discount and other financial terms, and such holder of the Registrable Securities sold in the Underwritten Offering shall be solely responsible for all such discounts and fees payable to such underwriters in such Underwritten Offering. Without the consent of the applicable holder of Registrable Securities subject to an Underwritten Offering, no Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Agreement shall include any securities other than Registrable Securities.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if holders of Registrable Securities engage or propose to engage in a “distribution” (as defined in Regulation M under the Exchange Act) of Registrable Securities, such holders shall discuss the timing of such distribution with the Company reasonably prior to commencing such distribution, and (ii) such distribution must not be for less than $75,000,000 of Registrable Securities held by such holders (provided that, if collectively the holders of Registrable Securities and their Affiliates do not own at least $75,000,000 of Registrable Securities, they shall be permitted to engage in such distribution with respect to all of the Registrable Securities held by them (for so long as they hold collectively at least $25,000,000 of Registrable Securities)).

(d) In connection with a distribution of Registrable Securities in which the holders of Registrable Securities are selling an aggregate of at least $200,000,000 of Registrable Securities, the Company shall, to be extent requested by managing underwriter(s) of such a distribution, be subject to a restricted period of the same length of time as such holder agrees with the managing underwriter(s) (but not to exceed 90 days) during which the Company may not offer, sell or grant any option to purchase Company Common Stock (in the case of an offering of Company Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for Company Common Stock) and any debt securities (in the case of an offering of debt securities) of the Company, subject to customary carve-outs that include, but are not limited to, (i) issuances pursuant to the Company’s employee or director stock plans and issuances of shares upon the exercise of options or other equity awards under such stock plans and (ii) in connection with acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions (subject to, in the case of this clause (ii), a limit not to exceed 10% of the Company’s then outstanding Company Common Stock).

Section 4.

Registration Procedures

(a) If and whenever the Company is required to use reasonable efforts to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act and in connection with any distribution of Registered Securities pursuant thereto as provided in this Agreement (including any sale referred to in any Take-Down Notice), the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement:

(i) use reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement to effect such registration in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution of such securities and thereafter use reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become and remain effective pursuant to the terms of this Exhibit A;

provided
, however, that the Company may discontinue any registration of its securities which are not Registrable Securities at any time prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement relating thereto;

provided

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification; provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall not release the indemnifying party from its obligation, except to the extent that the indemnifying party has been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure to provide such notice on a timely basis.

(d) In any case in which any such action is brought against any indemnified party, the indemnified party shall promptly notify in writing the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof and acknowledging the obligations of the indemnifying party with respect to such proceeding, the indemnifying party will not (so long as it shall continue to have the right to defend, contest, litigate and settle the matter in question in accordance with this paragraph) be liable to such indemnified party hereunder for any legal or other expense subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, supervision and monitoring (unless (i) such indemnified party reasonably objects to such assumption on the grounds that there may be defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to the defenses available to such indemnifying party and, as a result, a conflict of interest exists or (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed within a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and the indemnified party is or would reasonably be expected to be materially prejudiced by such delay, in either event the indemnified party shall be promptly reimbursed by the indemnifying party for the expenses incurred in connection with retaining one separate legal counsel (for the avoidance of doubt, for all indemnified parties in connection therewith)). For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any such assumption by an indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such matter and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party except as provided in the previous sentence. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of an action or claim effected without its consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). No matter shall be settled by an indemnifying party without the consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such claim or proceeding, (y)does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party and (z) is settled solely for cash for which the indemnified party would be entitled to indemnification hereunder. The failure of an indemnified party to give notice to an indemnifying party of any action brought against such indemnified party shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent such failure adversely prejudices the indemnifying party.

(e) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall survive the sale or other transfer of the Registrable Securities and the termination of this Agreement.

(f) If recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions for any reason or reasons other than as specified therein, any Person who would otherwise be entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall nevertheless be entitled to contribution with respect to any Losses with respect to which such Person would be entitled to such indemnification but for such reason or reasons, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party, the Persons’ relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. It is hereby agreed that it would not necessarily be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no holder of Registrable Securities shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of its net proceeds from the sale of the Registrable Securities subject to any actions or proceedings over the amount of any damages, indemnity or

contribution that such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

(g) The indemnification and contribution agreements contained in this Section 6 are in addition to any liability that the indemnifying party may have to the indemnified party and do not limit other provisions of this Agreement that provide for indemnification.

Section 7.

Facilitation of Sales Pursuant to Rule 144
. For as long as any holder holds Registrable Securities, to the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (including the reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144) and submit all required Interactive Data Files (as defined in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T of the Commission), and shall use reasonable efforts to take such further necessary action as any holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request in connection with the removal of any restrictive legend on the Registrable Securities being sold, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell the Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144.

Section 8.

Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights
. The rights to cause the Company to register Registrable Securities under this Exhibit A may not be transferred or assigned except pursuant to this Section 8.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict transfers of Registrable Securities to any lenders under the Margin Agreement or any of the Security Agreements, or a collateral agent on behalf thereof. The Stockholders may transfer or assign their rights pursuant to this Agreement to (i) any of their Affiliates and (ii) the lenders and collateral agent under the Margin Agreement or any similar financing arrangement.

Section 5.6

Assignment
. Except as contemplated by

Section 1.2
or the provisions of

Exhibit A
hereto, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment or delegation without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that Parent may make such assignment or delegation to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent without the prior consent of any other party hereto.

Section 5.9

No Third-Party Beneficiaries
. This Agreement is not intended to and does not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

Section 5.10

Severability
. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

Section 5.11

Remedies
. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by any party hereto; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the parties pursuant to this Agreement, in each case on the basis that such party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance or other equitable remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

Section 5.12

Governing Law
. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws, provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware, in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the Transactions and thereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any Legal Proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such Legal Proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such Legal Proceeding shall be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereto hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in

Section 5.4
or in such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Legal Requirements, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

Section 5.13

WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL
. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

Section 5.14

Further Assurances

Agreement (including in connection with any upsize thereof) or similar financing agreement, including but not limited to, an issuer or similar agreement.

No sales may be made under the applicable Registration Statement during any Blackout Period (with respect to clause (ii) of the definition thereof, of which the holders of Registrable Securities have or are deemed to have received notice).

In connection with any Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities for which a holder delivers a Take-Down Notice and satisfies the dollar thresholds set forth in first sentence above, and where the Take-Down Notice contemplates marketing efforts not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours by the Company and the underwriters, the Company will use reasonable efforts to cooperate and make its senior officers available for participation in such marketing efforts (which marketing efforts will not, for the avoidance of doubt, include a “road show” requiring such officers to travel outside of the city in which they are primarily located). The holder of Registrable Securities that delivered the applicable Take-Down Notice shall select the underwriter(s) for the Underwritten Offering;

provided

Such holder shall reasonably determine the timing of any such registration and sale.

(d) In connection with a distribution of Registrable Securities in which the holders of Registrable Securities are selling an aggregate of at least $200,000,000 of Registrable Securities, the Company shall, to be extent requested by managing underwriter(s) of such a distribution, be subject to a restricted period of the same length of time as such holder agrees with the managing underwriter(s) (but not to exceed 90 days) during which the Company may not offer, sell or grant any option to purchase Company Common Stock (in the case of an offering of Company Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for Company Common Stock) and any debt securities (in the case of an offering of debt securities) of the Company, subject to customary carve-outs that include, but are not limited to, (i) issuances pursuant to the Company’s employee or director stock plans and issuances of shares upon the exercise of options or other equity awards under such stock plans and (ii) in connection with acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions (subject to, in the case of this clause (ii), a limit not to exceed 10% of the Company’s then outstanding Company Common Stock).

(d) In any case in which any such action is brought against any indemnified party, the indemnified party shall promptly notify in writing the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof and acknowledging the obligations of the indemnifying party with respect to such proceeding, the indemnifying party will not (so long as it shall continue to have the right to defend, contest, litigate and settle the matter in question in accordance with this paragraph) be liable to such indemnified party hereunder for any legal or other expense subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, supervision and monitoring (unless (i) such indemnified party reasonably objects to such assumption on the grounds that there may be defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to the defenses available to such indemnifying party and, as a result, a conflict of interest exists or (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed within a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and the indemnified party is or would reasonably be expected to be materially prejudiced by such delay, in either event the indemnified party shall be promptly reimbursed by the indemnifying party for the expenses incurred in connection with retaining one separate legal counsel (for the avoidance of doubt, for all indemnified parties in connection therewith)). For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any such assumption by an indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such matter and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party except as provided in the previous sentence. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of an action or claim effected without its consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). No matter shall be settled by an indemnifying party without the consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such claim or proceeding, (y)does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party and (z) is settled solely for cash for which the indemnified party would be entitled to indemnification hereunder. The failure of an indemnified party to give notice to an indemnifying party of any action brought against such indemnified party shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent such failure adversely prejudices the indemnifying party.

(e) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall survive the sale or other transfer of the Registrable Securities and the termination of this Agreement.

(f) If recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions for any reason or reasons other than as specified therein, any Person who would otherwise be entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall nevertheless be entitled to contribution with respect to any Losses with respect to which such Person would be entitled to such indemnification but for such reason or reasons, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party, the Persons’ relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. It is hereby agreed that it would not necessarily be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata

or per capita allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no holder of Registrable Securities shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of its net proceeds from the sale of the Registrable Securities subject to any actions or proceedings over the amount of any damages, indemnity or contribution that such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

(g) The indemnification and contribution agreements contained in this Section 6 are in addition to any liability that the indemnifying party may have to the indemnified party and do not limit other provisions of this Agreement that provide for indemnification.

Section 7.

Facilitation of Sales Pursuant to Rule 144
. For as long as any holder holds Registrable Securities, to the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (including the reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144) and submit all required Interactive Data Files (as defined in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T of the Commission), and shall use reasonable efforts to take such further necessary action as any holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request in connection with the removal of any restrictive legend on the Registrable Securities being sold, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell the Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144.

Section 8.

Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights
. The rights to cause the Company to register Registrable Securities under this Exhibit A may not be transferred or assigned except pursuant to this Section 8. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict transfers of Registrable Securities to any lenders under the Margin Agreement or any of the Security Agreements, or a collateral agent on behalf thereof. The Stockholders may transfer or assign their rights pursuant to this Agreement to (i) any of their Affiliates and (ii) the lenders and collateral agent under the Margin Agreement or any similar financing arrangement.

Board of Directors

Splunk Inc.

270 Brannan St.

San Francisco, CA 94107

Members of the Board:

We understand that Splunk Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “

Company
”), Cisco Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“

Parent
”), and Spirit Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“

Merger Sub
”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “

Merger Agreement
”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “

Merger
”). The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger, and from and after the effective time of the Merger, will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (“

Company Common Stock
”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than (a) shares owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned by any direct or indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, (b) shares owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or subsidiary of Parent, and (c) Dissenting Shares (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to $157.00 per share, without interest (the “

Per Share Cash Amount
”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Per Share Cash Amount to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) (the “

Holders
”), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.

For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated September 20, 2023 (the “

Draft Merger Agreement
”), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial projections and operating data of the Company and sensitivities thereto (the “

Company Projections
”). Additionally, we discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior management of the Company. We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock and compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, we reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions, participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company, Parent and their financial and legal advisors, and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections, we have been advised by the management of the Company, and have assumed based on discussions with the management and the Board of Directors of the Company, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company and other matters covered thereby. We express no view as to the Company Projections or the assumptions on which they were based. We have assumed that the terms of the Draft Merger Agreement will not differ materially from the final executed Merger Agreement, and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay of any terms or conditions. In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated

benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or its affiliates nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, we have relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks associated with such technology and products. In arriving at our opinion, we were not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any party with respect to an acquisition, business combination or other extraordinary transaction involving the Company.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of which will become payable upon delivery of this opinion. We will receive an additional, larger fee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company or Parent, on the other hand, pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or Parent and their respective affiliates for which we would expect to receive compensation.

Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.

This opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose without our prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how stockholders of the Company should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which Company Common Stock will trade at any time.

Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Cash Amount to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the Holders, and we express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any class of such persons, relative to such consideration.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Per Share Cash Amount to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the Holders is fair, from financial point of view, to such Holders.

Yours faithfully,

Board of Directors Splunk Inc.

270 Brannan Street

San Francisco, CA 94107

Members of the Board:

We understand that Splunk Inc. (the “Company”), Cisco Systems, Inc. (the “Buyer”) and Spirit Merger Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (“Acquisition Sub”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated September 20, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”), which provides, among other things, for the merger (the “Merger”) of Acquisition Sub with and into the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer, and each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than shares (i)held in treasury, (ii)held by the Buyer or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer or the Company, or (iii)as to which appraisal rights have been validly exercised (and not withdrawn or lost) (collectively, the “Excluded Shares”), will be converted into the right to receive $157.00 per share in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares).

For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:

1)Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company;

2)Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company;

3)Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company (collectively, the “Financial Projections”);

4)Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior executives of the Company;

5)Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock;

6)Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the Company Common Stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the Company and their securities;

7)Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;

8)Participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company, the Buyer and their financial and legal advisors;

9)Reviewed the Merger Agreement and certain related documents; and

10)Performed such other analyses, reviewed such information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.

We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the Financial Projections, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company and of the future financial performance of the Company. In addition, we have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the definitive Merger Agreement will not

differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We are not legal, tax, or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax, and regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax, and regulatory matters. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the transaction. We have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

In arriving at our opinion, we were not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any party with respect to the acquisition, business combination or other extraordinary transaction, involving the Company, nor did we negotiate with any of the parties, other than the Buyer, which expressed interest to Morgan Stanley in the possible acquisition of the Company or certain of its constituent businesses.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will receive a fee for our services, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In addition, Morgan Stanley will receive a fee upon rendering of this financial opinion. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we or our affiliates have provided financial advisory and financing services for the Buyer and its affiliates and have received fees in connection with such services. In addition, Morgan Stanley is a counterparty to the Company with respect to a capped call transaction entered into by the Company in connection with the Company’s issuance of its convertible notes due 2027. The consummation of the Merger will result in the unwind of such derivative transaction and the Company or Morgan Stanley may be entitled to receive a net payment, in an amount to be calculated at the time of closing of the Merger. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Buyer, the Company and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.

Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing

investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the Buyer, the Company, or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in this transaction, or any related derivative instrument.

This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed without our prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing the Company is required to make with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with this transaction if such inclusion is required by applicable law. In addition, Morgan Stanley expresses no opinion or recommendation as to how the stockholders of the Company should vote at the stockholders’ meeting to be held in connection with the Merger. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available.

submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations or the converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation, and shall include in such notice either a copy of this section (and, if 1 of the constituent corporations or the converting corporation is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title) or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which this section (and, § 114 of this title, if applicable) may be accessed without subscription or cost. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, the surviving, resulting or converted entity shall notify each stockholder of each constituent or converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, and any beneficial owner who has demanded appraisal under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, of the date that the merger, consolidation or conversion has become effective; or ---(2) If the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent, converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation before the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, or the surviving, resulting or converted entity within 10 days after such effective date, shall notify each stockholder of any class or series of stock of such constituent, converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation who is entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent, converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation, and shall include in such notice either a copy of this section (and, if 1 of the constituent corporations or the converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title) or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which this section (and § 114 of this title, if applicable) may be accessed without subscription or cost.

Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving, resulting or converted entity the appraisal of such holder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to such entity by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs such entity of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, either (i)each such constituent corporation or the converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent, converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance or (ii)the surviving, resulting or converted entity shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection and any beneficial owner

who has demanded appraisal under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation or entity that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation or the converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given. ---(3) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section (but subject to this paragraph (d)(3)), a beneficial owner may, in such person’s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner’s shares in accordance with either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable; provided that (i)such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section and (ii)the demand made by such beneficial owner reasonably identifies theholder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, is accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the surviving, resulting or converted entity hereunder and to be set forth on the verified list required by subsection (f) of this section. ---(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, the surviving, resulting or converted entity, or any person who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, any person entitled to appraisal rights who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, any person who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive from the surviving, resulting or converted entity a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in § 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in § 251(h)(2) of this title)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate number). Such statement shall be given to the person within 10 days after such person’s request for such a statement is received by the surviving, resulting or converted entity or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section, whichever is later. ---(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by any person other than the surviving, resulting or converted entity, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon such entity, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by such entity. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving, resulting or converted entity, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list.

The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving, resulting or converted entity and to the persons shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving, resulting or converted entity. ---(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the persons who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the persons who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any person fails to comply with such direction, the Court

may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. If immediately before the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent, converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title. ---(h) After the Court determines the persons entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger, consolidation or conversion and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving, resulting or converted entity may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving, resulting or converted entity or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving, resulting or converted entity pursuant to subsection (f) of this section may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section. ---(i)The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving, resulting or converted entity to the persons entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such person upon such terms and conditions as the Court may order. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving, resulting or converted entity be an entity of this State or of any state. ---(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving, resulting or converted entity pursuant to subsection (f) of this section who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Court may order all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of this section or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under subsection (k) of this section. ---(k) Subject to the remainder of this subsection, from and after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person’s shares as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance). If a person who has made a demand for an appraisal in accordance with this section shall deliver to the surviving, resulting or converted entity a written withdrawal of such person’s demand for an appraisal in respect of some or all of such person’s shares in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, either within 60 days after such effective date or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such person to an appraisal of the shares subject to the withdrawal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall not be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Court made under subsection (j) of this section; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
